### General Approach for designing primers   

1. We use geneious to import and align sequence(s)    

2. Design primers based on the following criteria:

Oligos are analyzed with [OligoAnalyzer](https://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer)    
	
	* 50% GC content (40% min, 60% max) 
	* Try to have G's and C's in the 3' end (GC clamp)   
	* Both primer pairs should be +/- 1 C annealing/melting temperature    
	* Try to have primers that melt at 60 C.    
	* Minimize hairpinning, homo + hetero dimerization. Rule of thumb: usually -9 delta G.
