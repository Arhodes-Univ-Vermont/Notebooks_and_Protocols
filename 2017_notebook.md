**Introduction:**    
Notebook for 2017 new year. It'll log the rest of my dissertation and potentially new post doc ideas and/or projects

## List of projects and description   
* Hsp rxn norm: Understanding how the local thermal environment shapes thermal tolerance and stress response (using Hsps as a proxy for stress) in forest ants of the genus *Aphaenogaster*. CTmax and rxn norm of Hsp expression measured across forest ants from Fl to Maine.   
* Range limits: Identifying the factors/forces that set range limits in common forest ants (*Aphaenogaster picea*). Modelling + measured their cold physiology in forest ants of Maine and Vt.  
* Multiple stressors: Understanding how progressive desiccation and starvation impacts thermal tolerances in *A. picea*. We pre-treated with desiccation and starvation and then measured KO-time. We also measured the stress response.        
* Thermal niche paper: Collaborative paper understanding how the environment shapes the ability to withstand cold and hot temperatures. In field and in a common garden, we measured upper and lower thermal limits of ants from GA-Maine (2 species).    
* Stress in nature: Are ants stressed under experimental warming that projects climate change? Ants were collected from warming chambers (0-5 C increase from ambient) and we measured their stress response.

### Page 5: 2017-01-17. Project idea: The impact of temperature variation on ant colonly level performance.       


**Background**   
Ant colonies experience temperature fluctuations throughout the day and season. In response to temperature variation, ants must be able to forage under cool and hot conditions. One way to achieve high performance in the face of temperature variation is for the colony to match individual level performance with shifting temperatures. For example, for colonies with diverse genetic structures, some genotypes may forage better under cool or hot conditions. Multiply mated queens (*Pogonomyrmex*) will produce offspring with more phenotypic variation in traits, compared to singly mated queens (*Aphaenogaster*).     

**Notes:** Need to actually verify that foraging efficiency differs throughout the day in a colony, aka need to know more natural history. Look up Deborah Gordon's work. How will you address the confounding issue of demographic effects? Meaning what if there is genetic clumping of sperm and it corresponds to age polyethism, leading to the covariance between age and genotype. Also, the age structure of the colony itself may covary with genotype.       

**Question**   

1. Is the amount of physiological variation in upper thermal limits reflected in the number of fathers?    
2. Do ant colonies utilize different genotypes to forage throughout the day and season?    

or

Do ants display seasonal adaptation in forager performance?   

**Hypotheses**  

1. The number of fathers increases the amount of phenotypic variatnce in upper thermal limits.    
2. There is genetic structuring in the foragers throughout the day and season.    

**Predictions**    

1. Additive genetic variance in upper thermal limits will be proportional to the number of fathers.     
2. Thermally tolerant genotypes perform during the warmest parts of the day and vice versa for more cool tolerant genotypes.    
3. The more thermally tolerant genotypes start off at low frequency early on in the season, but increase in frequency at peak summer, then decrease again.    

**Experimental Design**   

I should do a power analysis to see how many ants and colonies I'd need to sample. Sam Scarpino has an R package for this I think.   

1. Document the natural history of 10 pogo colonies, to tune for sampling   
2. If there is like 10 foraging bouts, or 10 time slices through the day, sample ~30 ants for each colony at each time slice.   
3. Phenotype each ant: measure morphology (head width, leg lengths, alitrunk length, etc), number of ovarioles?, hydrocarbons, desiccation resistance, measure upper thermal limit   
4. Pool ants at each time slice, isolate DNA, and then pool-seq (capture-seq, but chatting with April, it sounds like biased sampling because only the portion of the first exon and promoter are sequenced.)     

**Critical Results or Alternative outcomes**  

1. Positive relationship between parentage and phenotypic variance.    
2. Structuring of alleles throughout the day or season. Some start off low, increase, then decrease in frequence.  This would indicate seasonal adaptation of foragers!     

It is possible that we won't find anything at all. But maybe because we're pool-sequencing, we can pick up the microbiome? And maybe that is structured diurnally or throughout the season.    

### Another idea: Compare parasite load between ant colonies with high and low number of fathers.    


Quick and dirty: One of the benefits of a diverse genetic background in a colony is disease resistance. So, test this by pool-seq experiment and measuring the parasite loads for ~30 individuals, potentially across a whole phylogeny of ants that vary in number of daddys and number of queens. Parasite load from different taxanomic groups (fungus, nemotodes, bacteria, viruses) can be mapped onto the phylogeny!

### Page 7: 2017-01-19. Making sense of reviewer comment; multiple stressors ms     


**Is there any direct evidence that heat shock proteins prevent heat knockdown?**    

Calabria et al. 2012 find differences in basal hsp70 protein expression but not heat-induced hsp70 expression between 3 genotypes of fruit flies( they differ in chromosomal structure). These differences were reflected in the fast ramp (0.1 C/min ramp), but not slow ramp(0.6 C/min ramping). 

3 genotypes:

1. O(3+4)/O(3+4): higher hsp70 basal expression and thermal tolerance under fast ramp;       
2. O(3+4+8)/O(3+4+8)    
3. O(st)/O(st): lower hsp70 basal expression and thermal tolerance under fast ramp;

* For looking at shifts in trade-offs between multiple stressors look up Nancy Emory, central cali, she is a plant evo ecologist   
* Selection gradient proj idea; JK asks what has been done in well known systems? ie. Arapidopsis (sp?), check Andy Schidth   

**2017-01-06; met with Ray Huey**    

Showed hsp rxn norm paper stuff:     
* Are parameters correlated- he was worrieda bout this.    
* Try fitting splines and extracting parameters     
* Selection on graits; linear or quadratic? non-parametric?       

**2017-01-07 Met with Dan Hahn and Greg Ragland**      

Went over data and Dan liked how Iparsed out all the predictions for the shifts in reaction norms of hsp gxp expression.    
* Finger example highlights the differences between resistance and tolerance    
* Pressing two fingers together without moving = **resistance**       
* When 1 finger moves the other finger but can move back = **tolerance**

### Page 10: 2017-01-26. Hoffmann et al. 2013, Functional Ecology Paper notes      


Starting off intro with constraints on upper thermal limits. 



**What can constraint upper thermal limits?**

1. low plasticity (stillmann paper shows this in crabs)
2. low adaptive potential (heritability)   
   * low variation in upper compared to lower thermal limits
3. Phylogenetic constraints inferred from strong phylogenetic signal. 
   * high lambda in PGLS for insects, lizards + snakes  

Some definitions: 

* heritability: degree of phenotypic variation in a trait that is genetic 
* evolvability: extent to which the trait's mean can shift under selection, which depends on the amount of genetic variation and mean values.  

Paper argues that mid-latitude species are most prone to heat stress (presently and to the future). Why? And what is mid-latitude?

### Page 11: 2017-01-26. Notes on teaching statements     


This science [article](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2006/04/writing-teaching-statement) has interesting advice. The teaching statement is usually a writing filter to weed out applicants who have not thought stuff through. Illuminates the character of the writer. It should be 1-2 pages. 



1. **Cater teaching statement to the institution**
2. **Demonstrate a real commitment to teaching** 
   * Low expectations on unique ways of teaching, but just show commitment (usually a sentence or two)
   * cite evidence, but be brief
3. Avoid presenting teaching as a 2nd priority
4. *Show us you care, but make it short and to the point* 
5. echo teachign interests in the cover letter, 1-2 sentences
6. Write about courses you'd like to teach!  For me, it'd be evolutionary physiology, evolution, computational biology?, ecological genomics 
   * cater this to the institution
   * display ideas, but don't be too ambitious
7. Teaching statement also indicates to the search committee how the applicant sees themselves in 
   * don't limit yourself to advanced courses, but also include beginners!
8. Display willingness to learn, pay attention, and change to reflect open mindedness and eagerness; shows you're not limited by what you are now
9. **Draw on your experieences as a student, a scholar, and human being** 
10. Don't promise too much

A good quote: 

`I used to assume that any student who did not get an "A" on an exam wasn't trying, until it occurred to me that no matter how hard I try in dance classes, I rarely excel. Becoming less critical of my students--while still maintaining high standards--has made me a better teacher.`

**Correlated response to selection for stress resistance.** 



Fruit fly paper doing a selection experiment on: 

1. cold (CS) in units of survival rate
   * chilled 5 C, recover 24 hours
2. heat (HS) in units of survival rate
   * hardened 30 min at 36C, recover 20 hours at 25 C, then heat shocked 38C 1 hour
3. desiccation (DS)
4. starvation (SS)
5. Heat knockdown time (KS) -in units of time (minutes)
   * KO at 40C
6. Lifespan (LS)

* And then they checked all of the traits from each selected line relative to controls. 
* 21 generations



1. Cold shock resistance (CS)
   * CS, HS, and DS all increased
2. Heat shock resistance (HS)
   * HS, KS, DS all responded
3. Heat knockdown resistance  (KS)
   * only KS responded

KS and SS increased developmental time. 



Upper and lower thermal limits can equally respond to selection after X generations in fruit flies. IN this experiment, there isn't necessarily a trade off betwween the two (except in cold shock resistance).

### Page 14: 2017-01-26. Mitchell & Hoffmann 2010, Functional Ecology; Thermal ramping influences evolutionary potential  


In fruit flies, they measured upper thermal limits as knockdown time in a static and ramping experiment. They did this in  a quantitative genetic design, so they could estimate the narrow-sense heritability (partition out variation to the additive genetic component).  They also measured this for ~11 species.  (looks like a lot of work)



**Methods:**

Slow ramp: 0.06 C/min

Fast, static HS: 38C preset temp



Fast and slow show a postive relationship. 



Set up a model to partition out variation Va (additive genetic variance), Vp (phenotypic variance), and Ve (environmental variance) and presented models for their coefficient of variation.



**Results**: 

* Ramping had low heritability(not sig different than 0), but static had high heritability (sig different than 0)
* Ramping had more environmental variance, but do the data need to be standardized first, such that the mean is 0 and variance i 1? No, the units are the same for both traits
* Ramping had higher phenotypic variance



**THoughts**

This paper contrasts a little bit with van Heraawarden & Sgrò paper, where they focus one 1 species. But they find that ramping, fast HS, and hardening all significantly correlate. But there is an additive genetic axis where

### Page 15: 2017-01-27. Embedding calender into webpage  


[Followed this tutorial](http://denisecase.github.io/2015/07/10/add-calender-to-site/): 

1. Create a  calender in google (gmail)
2. Go to settings
3. click calendars
4. go down to where it says embed this calendar, it is in html code, so copy that
5. tutorial goes through yml, but I just used the html code to make a new webpage with my calender in it and created a link in the navigation bar

[Here it is](https://adnguyen.github.io/calendar.html), useful for me to access my calender wherever I am now!

### Page 16: 2017-01-31. Sørensen et al. 2003; Ecology letters, The Evolutionary and ecological role of heat shock proteins  


Trying to get a handle on how this paper frames the role of Hsps with upper thermal limits. From the abstract, they mention it as a resistance mechanism. 



1. **Defining stress:**  a condition that disturbs the normal function of the biological system or a condition that decreases fitness (Hoffmann & Parsons 1991; Bijlsma & Loeschcke 1997)
   * I like part of the definition. I'd define stress **as a perturbation to a biological system that decreases fitness.** Or, a force acting on a biological system that decreases fitness. 
   * These forces can be *extrinsic* (environmental) and *intrinsic* (genetics, inbreeding, deleterious mutations, ageing).


2. **Hsp natural history** (cite Ritossa 1962 as first discovering heat shock response through chromosome puffs(which had Hsps on it))
3. **Protein quality control system (PQC)**: importance increases upon exposrue to environmental /genetic stresses
   * function is 2 fold: correct folding and to assist in degradation of denatured or aggregated proteins
   * not very informative
4. Stress as an ecoogical and evo force (Don't agree with the framing)
   * types of responses:
     * move, alter physiological state through hibernation or diapause
     * adapt or acclimate
     * fail and die
   * Adaptive change in Hsp over days (Nguyen et al. 1994; Ferguson et al. 1998) or over seasons (Fader et al. 1994; Hofmann & Somero 1995; Pyza et al. 1997; Miner et al. 2000) and natural populations(no citations, what?)
5. Effects of stress on rates of evolution
   * ​
6. **Costs of Hsp expression**
   * unclear whether reduced fitness is due to cost of acclimation or reared under poor conditions. Why would we tease these apart? 
   * Benefits of acclimation (stress /longevity) can be separated from costs
     * ex: Hercus et al. 2003: repeated mild stress lowered fertility and fecundity in the short term but not long term
     * One way to separte out costs and benefits is by altering acclimation treatments (Scott et al. 1997; Hoffmann & HewaKapuge 2000; Thomson et al. 2001; Wilson & Franklin 2002)
   * lowers fertility fecundity, energy, development, and survival 
   * Direct costs measured by Krebs & Feder 1998: hardened flies at different stages (1-3rd instar) in 4isofemale lines. Multiple heat exposures reduced survival but did not affect development time. Expression of Hsp70 was not correlated with survival, suggesting differences in expression cannot explain survival effects. 
   * said this already but high hsps lower growth and cell division (Feder et al. 1992; Krebs & Feder 1997, reduced reproduction (Krebs & Loeschcke 1994; Silbermann & Tatar 2000))
     * Silbermann & Tatar 2000 showed heat induced hsp expression reduced egg hatching of moms in fruit flies. 
     * Krebs & Loeschcke 1994 found reduced fecundity
7. **The role of Hsps for adaptation** 
   * Improved heat resistance of insects after hsp expression in **insects** ( (Gehring & Wehner 1995; Dahlgaard et al. 1998), **fish**(Basu et al. 2002) , plants (Sun et al. 2002), **mammals** (Ulmasov et al. 1993; Matz
     et al. 1996a). 
   * Some of the first data on the possible ecological relevance of Hsp expression comes from selection studies. In
     different species of Drosophila, it was shown that (contrary to predictions at that time) expression of Hsp70 was lower in lines frequently, or continuously exposed to severe stress (Bettencourt et al. 1999; Sørensen et al. 1999; Lansing et al 2000)
     * interpretation = costs of Hsp in pops exposed to stress outweighs benefits and adaptation is achieved through some other means
   * Density dependence might drive hsp expression 
   * Age will influence hsp expression
   * Life stages may differe in stressors exposed
     * Stage specific Hsp expression and resistance - no citation
     * not much support (Sørensen et al. 1999)
   * In adults, Hsp70 down regulated with decreasing heat stress resistance (Sørensen & Loeschcke 2002a)
8. **Conclusions and future prospectives**
   * ```However, new results show that Hsp expression is highly fine-tuned (not being only an on–off mechanism) and that Hsps are also continuously expressed after mild chronic stress exposure.```
   * Hsps as biomarkers of stress
   * ```However, local adaptation and selection for other kinds of adaptive mechanisms may disturb the evaluation of the results. The results by Sørensen et al. (1999, 2001) and Ko¨hler et al. (2000) showing that there is selection against Hsp expression in populations being exposed to chronic stress clearly demonstrates this problem.```

### Overall thoughts:  


Not very informative in terms of what Hsps are actually doing and how they relate to upper thermal limits. What is the difference between protection and resistance? Tolerance? Some consistent wording would be nice. The paper focused too much on costs and benefits rather than adaptive variation. This is nice to know but what aspect of the thermal ecology do Hsps relate to? I would have hoped there would be a better discussion fo basal vs induced hsps.

### Page 19: 2017-01-31. SHC lab meeting reading: Ranga et al. 2017; Evol Ecol: Sibling Drosophila species (Drosophila leontia and Drosophila kikkawai) show divergence for thermotolerance along a latitudinal gradient  


This study compares the different aspects of lower and upper thermal limits between two closely related species (*Drosophila*) in India across a wide climate gradient (8 -32 degrees north): 

1. *D. leontia*
2. *D. kikkawai*

==Measurements:==

1. **Upper thermal limits**
   * Heat knockdown time: 39 C treatment in water bath, measured time where they could not stand
   * Survival: 24 hour survey of flies 100% dead when treated at 39C over time (10-80min)
   * Hardening:
2. **Lower thermal limits**
   * Chill coma recovery time
     * 0C treatment for 8 hour then recover at room temp (22C); measured time they could stand upright
   * Cold survival 
     * 0 C treatment for 8 -96 hours, measured survival after 24hours
3. **Absolute hardening capacity (AHC)**
   * AHC = KT - C 
   * KT = thermotolerance after hardening
     * warm: (33, 35 or 37 C)
     * cool: (0, 2 or 4 C)
   * C = basal thermo-tolerance
4. **Relative hardening capacity**
   * RHC = (KT – C)/C
5. **Egg-to-adult viability**
   * Hot: eggs subected to 39 C 1 hour
   * Cold: eggs subjected to 0 C 12 hours
   * transferred to 22C 65% RH

## Results 

(Fig 2)

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * Clinal variation in Upper thermal limits (KD time, heat survival)
     * No benefit from hardening
   * No clinal variation in lower thermal limits ( CCRT, cold survival)
     * No benefit from hardening
2. *D. kikkawai* —==higher plasticity==
   * Clinal variation in Upper thermal limits (KD time, heat survival)
     - Benefit from hardening
   * Clinal variation in lower thermal limits ( CCRT, cold survival)
     - Benefit from hardening

Table 2: They did anova for each trait, testing the effect of each population

Why not do an ANCOVA:

```R
aov(Thermal trait~ Latitude * Species)
```



**Fig 3: Egg-to-Adult viability**

1. *D. leontia ==lower plasticity==*
   * Southern pop had higher viability under controls, heat stressed, but not cold stress. 
   * **Notes** *makes sense because they have no relationship to cold* 
   * ​
2. *D. kikkawai ==higher plasticity==*
   * Southern pop had higher viability under heat stress but lower under controls and cold stress.

**Fig 4: Mortality**

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * **HS:** No diff in mortality between hardening and controsl (consistent with fig 2)
   * **HS:** Southern had lower mortality  than north
   * **CS:** No diff between hardening and controls and pops
2. *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity==
   * **HS** higher mortality in control than hardened, makes sense; southern has lower mortality
   * **CS:**  Northern have lower mortality than south ; hardening has lower mortality

**Fig 5: AHC (Absolute hardening capacity) and RHC relative hardening capacity**: Same direction

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * no sig hardening between northern and southern pops
2. *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity==
   * Upper thermal limits: positive plasticity
     * Northern pops have higher upper thermal limits
   * Lower thermal limits: 
     * CCRT: northern have faster recovery time
     * survival: northern have higher survival



**Fig 6: Hardening vs pretreatment temperatures**

1. Upper thermal limits:
   * *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity== had higher hardening than *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity== for both KD time and survival
2. Lower thermal limits: 
   * *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity==  has higher cold tolerance than *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==

**Fig 7 looks the same, wtf**



**Figure 8** Focus on the climate variables each species experiences 

- North is more variable, south less variable (A)
- Tave and RH negatively related to latitude

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * higher abundance at the warm end
2. *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity== 
   * higher abundance at the cold end 

## Thoughts 

* What is the demographic history? I ask because it can explain some of the results. 


* Optimal temp for D. leontia is the south and D. kikkawai is in the north. So D. leontia could be moving south to north and D. kikkawai could be moving north to south. 
* Painful read, could have analyzed the data differently.

### Page 21: 2017-02-03. Todgham et al. 2017; JEB, The effect of temperature adaptation on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in notothenioid fishes  


Ref: Todgham AE, Crombie TA, Hofmann GE. 2016. The effect of temperature adaptation on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in notothenioid fishes. The Journal of Experimental Biology:jeb.145946.



**Background**

Ubiquitin tags proteins for degradation through the proteasome(protein chomper). In the face of heat stress, different species can adaptively modulate this pathway to cope with the deleterious effects of protein damage. 
 <u>Antarctic species live in -1.9C while new zealand species live in 10C .</u> 




**Objective:** Understand the thermal compensation of Ub-proteasome pathway in antarctic fish vs ones form warmer climates.

## Approach and workflow

**Compared ubiquitin ,proteasome activity and expression between 2 tissues (gill and liver) for 4 different fish species.** 

```mermaid

graph TD
A(Trematomus bemacchii) --> D{Antarctic fish}
B(Pagothenia borchgrevinki) --> D

R(Notothenia angustata) --> P{New Zealand}
G(Bovichtus variegatus) --> P

D --> M{Ub-proteasome pathway}

W --> T(CHIP)

W --> Ubiquitin

E --> PSMA2

E --> PSMC1


```

**Figure 1: UB conjugated proteins**

Antarctic and N. angustata have higher ubiquitin tagged proteins than B. variegatus for both liver and gill. 



**FIgure 2. Protasome activity** 

Antactic have higher proteasome activity at 0 and 10 C for both gill and liver. The magnitidue of differences were higher in the gills. This may be why they focused only on the gills for gene expression 



**Figure 3: Gill gxp for UB related genes**

  General pattern as Fig 1. where antarctic fish and N. angustata have higher expression of UB realted gene expression than B. variegatus. But N. angustata had higher expression than the antarctic fish. There could be different dynamics that would be captured with a reaction norm approach. 



**Figure 4: Gil gxn for proteasome complex related genes.** 

Similar result as figure 1. (exxcept top panel) . But here we see categorical differences between Antarctic and new zealand. Antarctic fish have higher expression. 



## Thoughts:

 It looks like cold tolerant species up-regulate their protein degradation pathway. It fits the model that if proteins are too damaged, they're clear those proteins. 



Cool method to test for proteasome activity: (Coux et al., 1996)

1.  chymotrypsin-like activities, which cleaves after large hydrophobic residues
2.  trypsin-like activities, which cleaves after basic residues
3.  peptidylglutamylpeptide hydrolyzing activities, which cleaves after acidic residues .

Interspecific- and acclimation-induced variation in levels of heat-shock proteins 70 (hsp70) and 90 (hsp90) and heat-shock transcription factor-1 (HSF1) in congeneric marine snails (genus Tegula): implications for regulation of hsp gene expression. J Exp Biol 205:677–685.



## Rational/Objectives/Questions

How do species adaptively vary in their stress response?



Species differ in vertical distribution

1. *Tegula brunnea* = subtidal 
2. *T. montereyi* = subtidal to low intertidal zones
3. *T. funerals* = low to mid intertidal zone (with wider latitudinal distribution) 
   * ==experiences the highest heat stress==



## Methods

1. Collected mid july and treated 13, 18 and 23 C for 30-34 days
2. Dissected tissues and isolated proteins
3. They measured protein levels of Hsp70/90/40, HSF with western blots.



## Take homes

*Our results indicate that the cellular thermometer model can account for intraspecific but not interspecific variation in Ton  and that the relative levels of expression of different isoforms of hsp70 may provide a better measure of heat stress than the total expression of all hsp70 isoforms.*



Figures are uninterpretable.

Tomanek L. 2010. Variation in the heat shock response and its implication for predicting the effect of global climate change on species’ biogeographical distribution ranges and metabolic costs. J Exp Biol 213:971–979.



This is one of the few papers that compare the thermal reaction norms of Hsp  protein expression among 3 different species. These species vary in the thermal environment



Species: *Chlorostoma* formerly *Tegula*

1. C. funebralis = warm tolerance
2. C. brunnea = intermediate tolerance
3. C. montereyi = low to intermediate tolerance



Figure 1.

These species shift the reaction norm of Hsp protein expression to the right, in support for the tolerance mechanism. And C. funebralis shifts their max expression upwards at the higher temperature. 



Some species lack HSR:

1. Hydra lack a HSR (Bosch et al. 1988)
   * mRNA gets rapidly degraded
2. antarctic marine organisms have little HSR
   * lacks inducibility of HSPs



**Argues that the variation in the thermal reaction norms of Hsp expression is related to the temperature variation different taxanomic groups experience.**

 <u>Title: Heat Shock proteins and stress tolerance</u> 


* ​
* Protection (resistance) and tolerance are assumed to be the same (conflated). 
* Induced thermotolerance = heat hardening; when exposed to sublethal stress and Hsps increase , it can confer resistance to future temperature threats
* *Nutrient availability, o x y g e n tension, diurnal rhythms, and a host of other variables exert highly reproducible effects on thermotolerance.*
* *In general terms, hsps function by preventing the accumulation of stress-damaged proteins.*
* ​

How does heat stress damage cells?

* Heat damages a wide variety of cellular structures and metabolic proc e s s e s (for detailed reviews, see Nover 1991; Laszlo 1992).*
* *In higher eukaryotes, one of the most immediate effects of heat shock is extensive disruption of the cytoskeleton (Falkner et al. 1981; Coss et al. 1982; Glass et al. 1985; Welch and Suhan 1985; Iida et al. 1 9 8 6 ) .*
* The golgi gets fragmented and number  of lysosomes increase.
* Mitochondria swell and decrease in number— decrease in oxidative phosphorylation
* influence gene expression; reduced
* DNA synthesis is slowed; inhibit chromatn assembly; DNA becomes unstable
* *The total protein content of the nucleus also increases with heat shock (Laszlo 1992).*
* changes lipid membranes; increased fluidity of bilayer and aggregation of integral membrane proteins

What is  the response?

* *In many cases, mild heat pretreatments, which induce hsp synthesis, either reduce the extent of these perturbations or speed their repair.*
* *Unfortunately, although we know that hsps have a central role in thermotolerance and have learned a great deal about the general biochemical functions of these proteins, w e still do not k n ow which heatinduced cellular perturbations are responsible for lethality or w h i c h lethal lesions are the most susceptible to repair by hsps.*

## Hsp70 function in stress tolerance (so this paper frames in term of tolerance)

* *early experiments showed a c l o s e correlation between their induction and the induction of tolerance to high temperatures (Li and Werb 1982; Li and Laszlo 1985; Subjeck and Shyy 1986).*
  * Li & Werb 1982 compare thermal tolerance with Hsp protein expression

Where is hsp70 localized during HS?

* concentrated in membrane, nuclei, and nucleoli (*Pelham 1984; Pelham et al. 1984; Velazquez and Lindquist 1984; Welch and Feramisco 1984*)



**In a f ew experiments, differences in thermotolerance among cultivars have been correlated with differences in hsp synthesis (Ougham and Stoddart 1986; Howarth 1989; Krishnan et al. 1989). **



**In o n e case, however, where the cosegregation of hsp polymorphisms and thermotolerance polymorphisms was examined, no simple correlation was observed (Fender and O'Connell 1989). **

### Page 25: 2017-02-07. How far down do Aphaenogaster colonies go in the winter?  


Lubertazzi 2012 has the answer. 



```
4.1.4.Winter. In winter months colonies avoid freezing temperatures
by maintaining their nests below ground. Talbot
[24] found the average depth of 5 winter colonies inMissouri
to be 25 cm. Colonies in Connecticut appear to prefer deeper
nests, to a depth of at least 50 cm. Developmental processes
enter a diapause and worker activity within the nest is
minimal.

```

==Depending on where they are, 25-50 cm!!!==

### Page 26: 2017-02-07. A definition of a trade-off.  


Reading Saltz et al. 2017, Trait Correlations in the Genomics Era; published in *TREE*



I like this: 



```
However, predictions about the evolutionary dynamics of trait correlations go beyond heritability: often we
are interested in why traits are correlated, whether the correlation evolved under selection, and
whether it is possible for selection or drift to change the magnitude or direction of trait
correlations.
```



Trade-off definition:

==Trade-offs occur when functional relationships among traits prevent evolution of optimum values for all traits simultaneously.==



or…when the relationships among traits prevent the evolution of optimal values for all traits simultaneously. 



or

when the correlational structure of functional traits are at odds with selection such that the suite of traits are not optimized.



## Thoughts

Should there be a distinction between a negative correlation among traits as a ==functional trade off==, vs how selection operates on traits to limit trait values in the next generation as an ==evolutionary trade off==?  Because if seleciton operates in the same direction of traits that are negatively correlated, then trait values are optimized. If seleciton operates perpendicular, then that'd be a trade off. 



I like this too:



```
Quantitative genetics theory suggests that identifying genetic loci underlying trait correlations can contribute to answering these questions. Specifically, quantitative trait loci can produce trait correlations through pleiotropy, in which a single locus causally affects two or more traits,
or through linkage, in which two or more loci each affect different traits, but are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and therefore are inherited together (Box 1). This distinction is important because trait correlations caused by pleiotropy are expected to evolve (adaptively and by drift) differently than trait correlations caused by LD. In general, because LD is expected to erode
through recombination, trait correlations generated by LD are expected to be transient and therefore have a limited scope for contributing to evolutionary change. Similarly, if a trait correlation is caused by LD, each trait might be produced by distinct functional mechanisms
```

### Page 27: 2017-02-09. SHC lab meeting: Practice talk for biolunch and dissertation defense  




SHC : overall intro is fine, you'll give it better every time you do it. you'll get smoother. 



==SHC has problem with question:==

What types of adaptations are needed to evolve into different environments?

What types of adaptations are needed to colonize different environments? (might want to be more specific, "thermally extreme environments")



SHC wants me to avoid, performance is physiology/ behavior. performance relates to fitness. They are not the same thing. 

In slide 8; I'm showing TPC's across a temperature gradient. The whole thing is shifting, but what im saying is that only ctmax is changing. thinka bout this. display diff



slide 9: there is an issue with me only presenting 1 option. There are other ways!!! don't necessarily talk about other ways. 

Slide 11: Engage with the figure: Here are the 3 heat shock proteins, but if i have a pathway, i better show how it works. Rethink. 



Slide 17: this is vague. I mean that the "dynamics of how they are used". This is what i want to stress. "Temperature selection" is too vague and I can say something more specific. 



Slide 18: this is confusing: too fast, both slide 18 and 19 have positive slopes and how ar they different? 

SHC suggestion: I want to get across, how do i use hsps to be better protected? Have them there all the time! Get across in plain english

Slide 19: Tolerance: when you do get damage, you repair it , turn on when needed and turn on stronger.

==Went too fast; and with graphs, it is hard for audience to get it==. Bar graph instead to give people the words (SHC is not sure)



If HSPs are contributing to thermal limits, how are they doing it? SHC confused as to why upper thermal limits is on y axis

==get rid of slide 20==



Slide 21: title is bad, instead: ants live in different environments. colonized environments from extremely cold to extremely hot!

Slide 22: Question 2 needs adjustments. How implies that it assumed they already adaptively vary. "relate" is vague, be more precise. 

Question 3 is awkward. SHC is not sure, think about how to frame it . How do upper thermal limits interact with other elements of physiology that relates to or influence species survival. or where species occur or performance 



slide 24: NOt clear that i used drosophila for blast search. Which ones in fruit flies are heat inducible? 

SHC suggestion: Save housekeeping business for this slide. Some are for heat response and some are for housekeeping function. Use fruit flies as a reference. Adds to story about shifts taht have gone on in these proteins used in ants as opposed to other insects. it is dynamic. 

==KM suggestions==

conclusions for each chapter was unclear:

multiple stressors: symbols for desiccation and starved were the same. change colors!

----

Slide 25: give a road map for the first time when i present hsp83 gene trees and regulatory elements. diverse group….some might not understand how you can infer duplication on a gene tree. 

**Slide 27: call it hsc70-4  instead of hsp70.**

What is going on with bombus? 



==Slide 30: have contrasting slide, meaning show hsp orthologues not heat inducible!==

Slide 31: Flat title. Conservation and innovation——say something about the evolutionary dynamics of hsps….they are conserved in fucntion, but there is alot of opportunity for innovation. Switch between housekeeping to inducible. There is more to be explored….i.e. subfunctionalization. Not a simple answer, there is a complex answer. Conserved function but the individual players is not static!



One time to make general statements about the implications of the work Im doing. Generalize so you can make general comments about biology. dont overstate but think critically!

Slide 33: both hypotheses don't belong on the same slide

Ask…whether there are adpative shifts in upper thermal limits when ants colonize novel environments. 

==This is what i want to know….==

Extension or enhancement of thermal limits. If you live in a warmer place, can you withstand higher temperatures.  

==if so, how do you do it?== Are hsps involved, how!?

**important**

Then go to the clade. species are structured along the cline. colonieze east coast over X million years. and they have colonized open environments. 

==Bonnie comments==

When i go into the predictions, make it explicit that they are predictions. 

Four main questions was confusing. I only have 3 points, but bonnie was expecting 4. 

Make sure im' clear on DW and FW

**MIstake** : I'm assuming that everybody will understand a phylogenetically informed appraoch. Give overview of approach! What is the phylogeny doing? Set up the audience to understand. More important to be understandable than lenght. 

Slide 35-40 I need to use titles!1



==Conclusion to CTmax part: I set up conflict, but my conclusion does not resolve the conflict.== Needs to be in plain english. 

Are the differences in CTmax explained by differences in how Hsps are used? 

**How does graded protection help/work?**



Tolerance mechanism is not a driver, it's a response to something else that is reducing the incidence of protein denaturing. 

Max is more about repair. 

three possibilities: 

1. protection - active
2. repair - active
3. tolerance - passive

Frame your question! Think about this to tell a precise story. 



RXN norm slides: connect it to something. Issue with how people study this. ANOVA approaches misses elements of adaptive changes in responses 



DW buffer thermal environment compared to FW.  Use data to decide whether i focus on habitat differences or to include cline in ctmax. 



For cahpter 2 conclusion: wrap up the whole chapter…thermal limits and hsp. Evolutionary lability or flexibilty in how hsps are used can lead or ability to colonize new habitats. LInk hsps back to habitat. integrate the data better

Natural shift to last question: The data i have might suggest, in the framework of climat change….DF species might be more protected because they dont get exposed to extremes. HOWEVER, climate change is not about change in temprature….but the constellation of chagnes associated with climate change . INcreases in temperature, other things are changing….other stressors can lead species to become more vulnerable. 

**Goals instead of topics.** Last part could be integrating my results with current climate chagne patterns. 



Slide 68: hypothesis slide for multiple stressors section

I have "or", split up the hypothesis

Slide 70: x axis in predictions could be severity. Overall, predictions are abstract. Explain cross protection or susceptibility mechanisms. ie extra stressor improves or reduces them. NO need for complex prediction slides. Why would another stressor can ever help you? (link back to HSPs…but don't need to add the data;; but you need the explanation)

You need methods: treatments, knockdown time explanation. All results need statistics.  Play with overall conclusion.

### Page 29: 2017-02-15. Aphaenogaster, Hsp rxn norm paper stats revisited:   


From previous analysis, I've found that there is a main effect of Tmax and Habitat type on CTmax in Aphaenogaster.

Ok, what if I take out flat woods species, do I still get clinal variation? 

```R

**Range of Tmax * 10**

```R

### For pca of hsp parameters:

0.3442608 0.2738906 
```

Here are the eigenvalues, and I want to get the number of dimensions $\frac{\lambda_{total}}{\lambda_{1}}$

```R
sum(pchsp$sdev)/pchsp$sdev[1]
4.81275 
```

Closer to 1 means that most of the variation mong these traits is captured by first pc. The larger the number, more PCs capture most of the variation among these traits.

### Page 31: 2017-02-21. Measuring evolutionary rates in darwins and haldanes    


I thought this was [cool](http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/courses.hp/biol606/OldLecs/rateunits.html):

a darwin ($d$): a change by a factor $e$ per million years



$$rate (d) =  \frac{ln(x_2)- ln(x_1)}{\Delta t}$$



* $ln(x_1)$ and $ln(x_2)$ are two sample means of natural logarthms of measurements
* $\Delta t$ is the time difference between the two samples in millions of years



a haldane (h): a change by a factor of one standard deviation per generation

$$rate(h) = \frac{\frac{lnx_2}{Sln_x}-\frac{lnx_1}{Slnx}}{t_2 - t_1}$$

* $ln(x_1)$ and $ln(x_2)$ are two sample means of natural logarthms of measurements
* $Slnx$ is the pooled standard deviation of $lnx_1$ and $lnx_2$ values
* $t_2 - t_1$ is the time difference between two samples, measured in generations

### Page 32: 2017-02-22. Resistance vs Tolerance strategies to stress; paper notes-**Núñez-Farfán et al. 2007**; The Evolution of Resistance and Tolerance to Herbivores; Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst.  


I want to get a sense of how the herbivore-plant literature uses certain words for responding to stress and potentially adopt that framework in temperature stress. 

1. **Resistance:** Constitutive or induced response of plants against herbivory to avoid or reduce the amount of damage
2. **Tolerance:**  Response of plants induced after consumption to buffer the negative fitness effect of damage. 

These definitions seem inter-related. For example, an induced response that can avoid or reduce damage could also buffer the negative effects of damage. So, a molecule (secondaryy compound) can participate in both resistance and tolerance. I think the difference is the timing of herbivory. Meaning, if a molecule turns on early, it is acting to resist herbivory damage. But if a molecule turns on after herbivory, then it's action will tolerate the damage already done. 

In the coral literature, they like to use ["frontloading"](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/4/1387.full) as another term for resistance. 

```
ref: Barshis DJ, Ladner JT, Oliver TA, et al (2013) Genomic basis for coral resilience to climate change. PNAS 110:1387–1392. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1210224110
```

**In Fineblum and Rausher 1995;** they explain tolerance as the amount of reduced fitness for a given amount of damage, but resistance is the amount of damage a plant experiences for a given abundance of herbivores. 

```
ref:   Fineblum WL, Rausher MD (1995) Tradeoff between resistance and tolerance to herbivore damage in a morning glory. Nature 377:517–520. doi: 10.1038/377517a0
```

**A diff expalantion of tolerance and resistance by Mauricio et al. 1997:**


 <u>Resistance:</u> 
 Traits that reduce the amount of damage a plant experienced. 


 <u>Tolerance:</u> 
 Ability of plant to sustain a fixed amount of herbivore damage without reduction in fitness.

A gem in this paper for the definition of a trade off:

> For example, a negative correlation between two characters, both within and across species, is often taken to indicate the existence of tradeoffs between those characters (Cheverud 1984, Tilman 1990).

```
ref:   Mauricio R, Rausher MD, Burdick DS (1997) Variation in the Defense Strategies of Plants: Are Resistance and Tolerance Mutually Exclusive? Ecology 78:1301–1311. doi: 10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1301:VITDSO]2.0.CO;2
```



In a diff system, but another [paper's definition](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000150): 

>  Two routes to decreasing susceptibility to infection are resistance (the ability to clear pathogens) and tolerance (the ability to limit damage in response to pathogens).

```
ref:   Ayres JS, Schneider DS (2009) The Role of Anorexia in Resistance and Tolerance to Infections in Drosophila. PLOS Biology 7:e1000150. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000150
```

Makes no sense….clearing pathogens limits the damage…And clearing a pathogen involves sensing and then responding to pathogens. 

> The first, resistance, is the ability of the host to reduce pathogen levels. The second, tolerance, is the ability to limit the impact of infections.

This makes more sense. 

**Thoughts:** 

I think there are two distinct parts of stress:

1. Whether you encounter it at all. This should involve resistance because there can be ways for organisms to avoid or reduce the amount of stress
2. What do you do when you encounter stress? You can limit the damage caused by it. 

But there is a continuum right? Especially for temperature. 

### How would I define resistance or tolerance in terms of thermal stress biology? Or more generally?    


Resistance is a response (either induced or already present) that impedes disruption of a complex trait/biological system from a perturbation. 

Tolerance is a response that mitigates the disruption of a complex trait/biological system from a perturbation. 

Not sure about these definitions. In real biology, how would this work?

```
		 resistance
		|-----
		|	  \
		|	   \
fitness  |		 \
		|		   -------
		|           tolerance
		______________________
		      leaf damage
```

The amount of leaf damage that does not decrease fitness is resistance. The part where the curve begins to change is tolerance. Can use a breakpoint analysis. 

```
		 
		|		--------
		|	   /  		 \
		|	 /	   		  \
fitness  |	/	 			\
		|/
		|           
		______________________
		      Temperature
```

The slope at the ends would indicate tolerance. But the width of topt may be resistance. 

Not sure this works. 



### Update: 2017-03-09  




Another paper with a definition to think about:

> Plant defence against any type of stress may involve resistance (traits that reduce damage) or tolerance (traits that reduce the negative fitness impacts of damage).

ref:   Agrawal AA, Conner JK, Stinchcombe JR (2004) Evolution of plant resistance and tolerance to frost damage. *Ecology Letters*, **7**, 1199–1208.

Calculating basal expression. Subtracting ct values of hsp83,hsc70-4, and hsp40 from 18srRNA ct values. And then log2 transforming the data to get a measure of basal expression 

```R
basalxp<-log2(jj[,3:5] - jj[,74])
jj<-data.frame(jj,basalxp)
```



Constructing the multiple regression model:

```R
regmod<-lm(KO_temp_worker~hsc70.1+hsp83.1+hsp40.2+FC_hsc70_1468_max+FC_hsc70_1468_slope+FC_hsc70_1468_Tm+FC_hsp40_541_max+FC_hsp40_541_slope+FC_hsp40_541_Tm+FC_Hsp83_279_max+FC_Hsp83_279_slope+FC_Hsp83_279_Tm,data=jj)
```

Model selection based on AIC in both directions (forward and backwards):

```R
summary(stepAIC(regmod,direction="both"))
#output
Call:
lm(formula = KO_temp_worker ~ hsp40.2 + FC_hsc70_1468_max + FC_hsp40_541_slope + 
    FC_hsp40_541_Tm + FC_Hsp83_279_max + FC_Hsp83_279_slope, 
    data = jj)

### Another set of analyses:   


> Also, can you test the relationship between the PCs and CTmax without the open habitat species?  This is to see if the same axis of variation also underlies CTmax variation without the big jump associated with the habitat shift.



Assembling dataset with pcs of hsp params with original data:

```R
jj3<-data.frame(jj,hspparams)

summary(jj3$habitat_v2)
#deciduous forest       flat woods 
 #             32                9 

noop<-subset(jj3,jj3$habitat_v2!="flat woods")
#summary(lm(KO_temp_worker~pc1+pc2+pc3,data=noop))
summary(lm(KO_temp_worker~pc1,data=noop))

Coefficients:

### Rational for determining how many PCs to include in analysis  


Found a source [here](http://strata.uga.edu/8370/lecturenotes/principalComponents.html):

> Because reduction of dimensionality is a goal of principal components analysis, several criteria have been proposed for determining how many PCs should be examined and how many should be ignored. One common criteria is to ignore principal components at the point at which the next PC offers little increase in the total explained variation. A second criteria is to include all those PCs up to a predetermined total percent explained variation, such as 90%. A third standard is to ignore components whose explained variation is less than 1 when a correlation matrix is used or less than the average variation explained when a covariance matrix is used, with the idea being that such a PC offers less than one variable’s worth of information. A fourth standard is to ignore the last PCs whose explained variation is all roughly equal.

### Page 35: 2017-02-23. What are Evolutionary Innovations?   




Reading this paper:   

Hunter JP. 1998. Key innovations and the ecology of macroevolution. Trends in Ecology & Evolution 13:31–36.

Different definitions: 

Miller 1949: 

> key adjustments in the morphological and physiological mechanism which are essential to the origin of new major groups

I like this definition because it describes the emergence of traits with a diversification of a clade. 



**Van Valen 1981:** 

> A key character, in the adaptive sense, is a structure or element of physiology that makes a taxon more or less committed to a way of life different from, or appreciably more efficient  than, that of its ancestors. 

I like how this definition highlights the traits in a new species do better than ancestral ones. So there is a time aspect. 

**Levinton 1988:**

> key innovation is necessary,but not sufficient for a subsequent radiation

**Baum & Larson 1991:**

>  a trait that greatly modifies the selective regime of the linearge in which it evolves

Don't think this is exactly right. Modifies does not have a direction of effect. 

**Rosenzweig & McCord 1991:**

> a key adaptation is a change in the mathematical rule governing a trade-off constraint so taht after the change, the trade-off is less severe

I wouldnt call this a key innovation. Instead, I'd call it breaking a trade off.

**Erwin 1992:** 

> Key Innovations characterize particular clades and are both necessary and sufficient to explain diversification within the clade

What the...

**Heard and Hauser 1995:**

> An evolutionary change in individual trats that causally linked to an increased diversification rate in the resulting clade (for which it is a synapomorphy)

But this definition excludes new species(forms) that have been able to persist in new environments, but have low diversification rates. 

This paper also proposes 3 mechanisms:

1. allowing escape from competition via invasion into a new adaptive zone
2. decreasing probability of extinction by increasing population density via increased individual fitness
3. favoring reproduction or ecological specialization

I think point 3 captures point 1 and 2 simultaneously. 



My own words:

Evolutionary Innovations: 

1. Critical adaptations that facilitate the emergence of new species. 
2. The evolution of critical traits that have enabled species to diversify
3. Adaptations that have enabled species to diversify
4. Evolutionary change in a characteristic that enhances persistance in a new species compared to ancestors

### Last biolunch  


Nate:

* Ants are still here…problem with yesterday's adaptation is today's constraint
  * go through argument: yesterday's adaptation is today's constraint—generalizable to the whole clade? ; cross susceptibility, 
* Ants should be resilient

Aimee: 

* Range limits question; can't they move? Then, they'd be resilient.

Melanie Lloyd: 

* I should change fold induction as delta delta CT

Brent's comments:

* semantics; evolutionary innovations makes it sound like something is novel, but it is tweaking an already established molecular mechanism. 
  * careful if you're using evo inn for a paper
* fitting lines to HSR; what I'm looking at is the kinetics of the heat sohck response. How does that change across evo time and diff time
* describing HSR; summarize it a little quicker(i had 3 slides) it could be more succinct so you can get into your experiments. 
* motivation for importance: showing some data that actually substantiates that Hsps are important for thermal tolerance. (good example in drosophila). Hsps are not just a biomarker of stress. Higher hsps = confers greater heat tolerance.  Link Hsp with upper thrmal limits better.
* Setting up predictions for protective vs tolerance: show previously published data showing each protection /tolerance….but tell everybody that people dont systematically look at Hsps and it's role in upper thermal limits. Protection (George's papers; Dong Millers in limpets 2008 or 2009 ish).
* Presenting Hsps gene phylogneies: make it clear which paralogues and orthologues correspond with each species 
* 1st chapter is less well rounded; I went too fast. 
* Why use thermal performance curves? Take it out? 
* At the very end; safety margins but I never plot safety margins. I have my own data, plot it out! And describe it
* "I don't believe it". Small heat shock proteins , ants have small hsps.  A matter of miscommunication



NJG:

* Change his picture 
* Too many "um"s
* I can start with climate change and ants have adaptations to buffer it's effects. 

Melissa's comments:

* Ants are everywhere and can adapt to anything; but it doesn't show finer scale phylogenetic relationshps on that 
* There is constraint based on evo history and that may limit future adaptive potential 
* Have broad map; and then have differences in species ranges and some species dont have a large range; some are secluded. 
  * show map of ant species distributions (show number); they're not all everywhere
* set audiance up for conclusion;by showing in differences in how species inhabit the world ; there is potential for specialization and diversification 
* Spent a long time on Hsps and HSEs without us knowing where it is going. It is nice to have outline for 2 stories. Suggest brief outline slide
* Tighten up what I say about HSE and Hsps. Make it shorter.
* General comment: Innovations. Not the right word. Morphological trait based thing. 
* =="I'd like to tackle" in my dissertation: Say , the question that "I have addressed"==
* Don't call them chapters: talk for 3 questions. "Call it my research" or refer to it that way. 
* for multiple stressors part: there is a biotic and abiotic effect on species
* in multiple stressors part: say sequentially so that people know. 
* When people interrupt me: Say "Great" instead of, where was I? 
* Conclusion: These results suggest that if species didnt adapt in a warm environment they may face exctintion. 
* ==Set up why this idea of yesterday's adaptation is today's constraint is a novel conclusion==
* Make habitat pictures up front. Make pictures the same size. 
* describe the word passive in slide 63; be more explicit in what the Tm shift means
* Show the people what journey they're about to go on. 
  * Tell them what you're about to tell them
  * Tell them
  * Tell them what you told them
* ​



Committee meeting:

* SHC wants me to add proteome stability work if I get NSF. 
* Send out multiple stressors manuscript
* Date set as March 29th

### Page 38: 2017-02-28. Questions to think about from SHC  


In regards to a new paper in JEB finding that cataglyphis ants have higher constitutive protection than induced response. 



SHC

> A good opportunity for you to think about why you found the results that you did – desert Cataglyphis show a shift from induced to constitutive protection, while the Aphaenogaster you surveyed do not.  What might be going on? 

 me:

> One possibility is genetic assimilation where an inducible response evolved into a constitutive one. In other words, evolving into an extremely hot environment requires constant protection from protein damage, while Aphaenogaster turns on Hsps when they encounter protein damage.

SHC

> That’s a mechanistic process, not an explanation for *why* Cataglyphis would make this change while Aphaenogaster would not. 

me:

> Disagree. I explained the why. Maybe you’re looking for this: Temperature variation shapes the plasticity in the heat shock response. If Aphaenogaster live in a more variable environment, then the HSR should be more plastic, while Cataglyphis lives in constant, extreme heat has a less plastic HSR and is constantly on to cope with heat stress. 

SHC:

> Yes, that is in fact better – your first answer was genetic assimilation, with the why partially implied in a follow-up sentence.  But genetic assimilation is a how answer, not a why.  Your PNAS discussion paragraphs will need to have the topics of discussion clearly separated out, not combined into one. ==Do you think you might have seen constitutively higher levels of Hsps if you had included the western members of the genus, or members of the outgroup?  What is the value of looking at the set of species you’ve included instead of (or in addition to) looking at species inhabiting environmental extremes?==

### Page 39: 2017-02-28. More analyses for hsp rxn norm paper  




From SHC:

> Another question for you regarding the PNAS analyses.  I am wondering whether the significant effect of “phylogeny” you are picking up is really just a significant effect of species (ie conspecifics are really genetically similar, much more so than species are to one another, and really phenotypically similar and live in really similar environments).  I know the independent contrasts was pretty sparse, but perhaps you could color the points on your scatterplot by species and add best-fit lines to show 1) whether the species differ, and 2) whether there are relationships between environment and CTmax within species.  Just to have a look at it. 



Constructed a model to test the interaction of Tmax and species id(factor), Tmax and habitat type:

```R

Results: It looks like ashmeadi is the reference and all species differ except lamellidens and floridana. I should just do an ANOVA and do a post hoc test to see which ones are diff.

**SDiamond suggested I do include species as a random effect:** 

umod3  = additive model between tmax and habitat

umod4= interaction between tmax and habitat

Used anova to compare models

```R
library(lmerTest) # gives p-values for lmer model
umod3<-lmer(KO_temp_worker~bio5+habitat_v2+(1|rad_seq_species),data=Aph.dat)
umod4<-lmer(KO_temp_worker~bio5*habitat_v2+(1|rad_seq_species),data=Aph.dat)

anova(umod3,umod4)
>refitting model(s) with ML (instead of REML)
Data: Aph.dat

### Page 40: 2017-03-04. Visit at UF; feedback on dissertation talk.      


Reflecting on visit at UF. 

**Dissertation talk:**

Clancy- part of habitat shifts I see may be due to fire disturbance in flat woods.

Leigh- "I don't believe that the CTmax shifts are related to temperature differences"

In the same vain…some PI named Rob that I met at "zoocial" suggested that I just use land cover. I think I'll use this: https://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd2011.php (this is land cover)

[tree cover data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nlcd-2011-percent-tree-canopy-cartographic)



I got a ton of questions on migration…what the…I didnt focus on this or research this at all. Hmm maybe it would be nice to include pop gen data? Is there viability selection on colony founding among different habitats? 

**Individual meetings:**

Brett: Thought my data were interesting. Suggested to follow up with a biology letters paper by including range size for each species. 

Dan Holt: Consider the effects of both abiotic and biotic interactions in setting range limits. You should read one of his old papers. Also, comparing regression tree with maxent models would be a small paper. He tries to publish in American Naturalist every year. It is his favorite journal too.

Bryony: Being more computational will help you. 

Michael: BAMM still up in the air. 

Christine Miller: Quant gen of sexual selection. males have fancy legs and compete for mates. Doing a phylogenetic approach- reconstructing ancestral states of host plants and morphological innovations.

Baer: mutation accumulation in C. elegans. Has done some networks on metabolites. Odd way to plot things, should try fitness on y and metabolite on x. 



### Getting tree canopy cover data  


NLCD 2011 Percent Tree Canopy (Cartographic) [data download](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nlcd-2011-percent-tree-canopy-cartographic)

> The National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD2011) USFS percent tree canopy product was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium (www.mrlc.gov). The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies, consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service, the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, NASA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. One of the primary goals of the project was to generate current, consistent, and seamless national land cover, percent tree canopy, and percent impervious cover at medium spatial resolution. This product is the cartographic version of the NLCD2011 percent tree canopy cover dataset for CONUS at medium spatial resolution (30 m). It was produced by the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC). Tree canopy values range from 0 to 100 percent. The analytic tree canopy layer was produced using a Random Forests? regression algorithm. The cartographic product is a filtered version of the regression algorithm output.

### Page 42: 2017-03-09. General reading notes:       






ref:   Huey RB, Kearney MR, Krockenberger A *et al.* (2012) Predicting organismal vulnerability to climate warming: roles of behaviour, physiology and adaptation. *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences*, **367**, 1665–1679.

> Williams et al. [5] developed an integrative framework for assessing traits that promote vulnerability. They proposed that the vulnerability of a species depends on its sensitivity to environmental change, its exposure to that change, its resilience or ability to recover from perturbations and its potential to adapt to change.



A general framework to think about organismal response to climate warming: 

1. thermal sensitivity
2. exposure
3. recovery  or resiliency
4. adaptive potential

How do yo measure these things? 

1. thermal performance curves
2. location, properties of TPCs, behavioral reg, look at life stages
3. ?
4. adaptive potential, additive genetic variance



**Looking for good ref for responding to climate change by acclimation, adaptation, and/or migration.**

What is K+ conductance doing? 

>For insects, it has been demonstrated that increasing temperature in Locusta migratoria increases the K conductance.of neurons, resulting in nerve transmission failures; that similar failures can be induced by adding K to the extracellular fluid (simulating increased K conductance; Money et al. 2009); and that such failures can be prevented by pharmacologically blocking K channels (Wu et al. 2001).



Hhigher survival to heat stress is associated with decrease nerve membrane K+ conductance

> Additionally, increased survival after sublethal heat stress has also been associated with a decrease in nerve membrane K conductance (Ramirez et al.1999; Money et al. 2009).



Review of action potentials:

> High permeability indicates that particle *mass* moves easily through a membrane. High conductance indicates that electrical *charge* moves easily through a membrane.

Conductance is the inverse of electrical resistance. If conductance is low, then the resistance of that ion to move across the membrane is high. 

K+ more concentrated inside cells.

**Go over dissertation talk.**

Are there any glaring things I need to fix? 

Biggest worry: PHylogenetic, PNAS chapter. ==Conclusions felt short, stilted and peices didnt stitch together.== 

Treat phylogenetic part of statistics ; using species as a random effect—not over-ascribing effects of phylogeny. Random effect- there is an independent effect of habitat and temperature. Change in stats might change how I told the story. 

In the ms itself, for reference:

> Colonies within different lineages differed in CTmax between forest habitats (β=1.37 ± 0.253; t=5.38, p <0.001) and with the local thermal extremes (Tmax, β=0.013 ± 0.003; t=3.52, p <0.001; Full model: F2,97=33.58; R2=0.40, p<0.001; Fig 2B). 



Need to change to random effects model

Changed sentence to: 

> When including species as a random effect, colonies within different lineages differed in CTmax between forest habitats (β=1.05 ± 0.379; t=2.76, p <0.05) and with the local thermal extremes (Tmax, β=0.014 ± 0.006; t=2.17, p <0.001;Fig 2B). 





Amanda suggestion: Broader implications? What types of changes we'd expect to see? turnover? certain populations within a species go extinct. Focus on turnover, different areas where ants are locally adapted to climate. Stick with a consistent flow. Specific—>meaning for ants on a large scale. What else do we need to understand? Expecting to hear a broad statement, but didnt hear it and came to a conclusion on it's own. 



My own notes: 

* incorporate ch1 and2 better…dynamic shifts at the gene copy level, and also how they are regulated. 
* Hsps are absoltuely critical for coping with heat stress. 
* hsps can be adaptively tuned over relatively short to broad evolutionary time scales. 
* Evolution of tolerance may make sense because Hsps are costly, and always activating them slows growth, so they should be only turned on when stress is encountered. 
* To respond to climate change, species will need to turn on Hsps all the time?

Notes from SHC for the discussion:



> - Samepattern of change associated with change in thermal stress within deciduousforest as with shift to more open habitat – common regulatory control such that response can be tuned up or down in a coordinated fashion  in response to selection?  
> - Studyof extreme thermophiles suggests a shift from induced to constitutiveprotection, but this may not be representative of thermal diversification in seasonalenvironments (or less extreme? Or non-desert?). Why not?
> - Protectionis usually thought of in terms of baseline levels, but important to rememberthat this can also be achieved through the induction response via graded orearly-onset protection.  Shift to a moregraded response suggests a change in trigger of Hsp gene expression (fromdirect feedback from denatured proteins to some other temperature sensor –something like HSR1 non-coding RNA?)



Taking out a part of my intro:

> Therefore, the patterns of Hsp gene expression may reveal evolutionary adaptations for
> coping with high temperature (Somero 2011). Evidence for the protection
> mechanism would be elevated levels of Hsp gene expression at relatively benign
> temperatures such that organisms are prepared for future lethal temperatures.
> For example, experimentally elevating Hsps at sublethal levels in fruit flies increased
> survival to extreme heat shock (Cavicchi et al. 1995). Evidence for the
> tolerance mechanism would be the increase of Hsp gene expression in concert
> with temperature increases. For example, the onset of Hsp induction positively
> corresponds with thermal limits in marine snails species (Lars and Somero 2002).

This paragrpah doesn't make that much sense but it has good citations:

> Among studies, evidence supporting the protection and
> tolerance mechanism by is mixed. For example, in controlled heat-shock
> experiments warm-climate populations or species may express Hsps at lower (Dahlhoff
> and Rank 2000; Bedulina et al. 2013) or higher levels (Dietz and Somero 1992;
> Tomanek and Somero 2000). In some cases, warm- and -cool adapted populations or
> species lack adaptive variation in Hsp expression altogether (Madeira et al.
> 2015; Lockwood et al. 2010; Jensen et al. 2010), which might imply no role for Hsps
> in extending upper thermal limits. Moreover, Hsps participate in many other
> biological processes unrelated to heat (Sørensen et al. 2003). For example,
> Hsps can induce in response to oxidative, desiccation, and osmotic stress (Morris
> et al. 2013). However, detailed knockout studies definitively show that thermally
> responsive Hsps are required for mounting a heat shock response (Bettencourt et
> al. 2008). Perhaps adaptive tuning of Hsp gene induction is not possible with rapid
> temperature selection (Sikkink et al. 2014) or in quickly diversifying clades. 



2017-03-14: Plopping my discussion here for reference. A lot of it has to be re-written.  

> Thetransition from closed canopy forests (deciduous) to open canopy pine/oaksavanna, supported by phylogenetic reconstruction and ancestral trait analyses(Fig ), was accompanied by increased upper thermal limits (CTmax; Fig ). The extensionof CTmax was associated with differences in the reaction norms of Hspexpression that reflected both protection and tolerance mechanisms. In supportof the protection mechanism, colonies with higher CTmax had higher expressionat the low end of the temperature gradient simply by slowing expression ratesfor *hsp70* and *hsp40*. In support of the tolerance mechanism, colonies with higher CTmaxexpressed all three Hsps at a higher temperature (Tm) and also to a highermagnitude (maximum expression). Out of the parameters that significantlyexplained variation in CTmax, six out of twelve parameters diverged betweenforest type (Fig). The adaptive modification of Hsps altogether highlightscomplex and non-linear patterns of gene expression.  
>
> ​            The structure of habitats is known alterthe thermal experiences of ectotherms (Brett et al. 2014). For temperate forestants, local environmental temperatures and habitat type have shaped thevariation in thermal traits (Fig ). Deciduous forests species are significantlybuffered from thermal stress than flat woods species due to higher canopy cover(Supplemental), especially over the growing season where foraging activity ishighest. These species are known to utilize behavioral thermal regulation suchas migrating to new nesting locations when they experience unsuitableenvironments and workers may maintain optimal body temperatures by avoidingsolar radiation in the leaf litter, also known as the Bogert effect (Bogert1945). Despite these behavioral activities, forest ants still experienceselection from the thermal environment because there was still clinal variationin Ctmax (Fig 2). In contrast to deciduous forest species, flat woods speciesnest near the surface (13-92 cm in depth; Tschinkel 2011) and are not known tomigrate whole at all (), which subjects them to thermal stress because surfacesoil can become superheated (Porter and Gates 1969; Angilletta 2009). Ifforagers navigate through superheated surface boundary layers, they must rely physiologicalmechanisms to withstand heat stress (). Thermal extremes are known to structurethe diversity of upper thermal limits in ant communities even within the samelocation (Kaspari 2015). For example, in the tropics, ants possess greaterCTmax in the canopy and experience more heat bouts than ants in the leaf litter(Kaspari 2015).
>
> ​            The phenotypic divergence of CTmax inforest ants were explained by 68% of the variation in parameters that representthe sigmoidal shape of Hsp expression. The parameters themselves are correlatedshow large amounts of independent axes of variation for which selection canoperate upon and in fact, we find roughly five effective numbers of dimensionsfrom a PCA analysis (λtotal/λPC1; supplemental). Perhaps high dimensionality is reflected bythe fact that Hsps play other critical roles in the cell (Morris et al. 2013)and are highly pleiotropic. However, only the first PC, which best captured thecorrelation between slope, Tm, max, but not basal gene expression, related themost to CTmax. Each parameter of the Hsp reaction norm captures the non-linearaspect of Hsp gene expression where detection of adaptive variation or lack thereofdepends on the sampled temperature. For example, when sampled at a singletemperature slice along the temperature gradient, differences in Hsp reactionnorms between open and closed forest habitats showed lower, higher, or nodifference at all in Hsp expression. Therefore, sampling dictates where onefinds adaptive variation of a trait without a function-valued approach. This isone of the first studies to our knowledge, to empirically capture thenon-linear process of Hsp gene induction as a function-valued trait(Stinchecombe).
>
> ​            The net effect of shifts in Hsp expressionparameters suggests that colonies with higher CTmax can better maintain proteinhomeostasis in subtle ways that are highly dynamic. For 2/3 Hsps, we foundevidence for protection through graded, but not constitutive means.Constitutive protection may strictly be modulated under different acclimationtemperatures (Helms Cahan et al. 2017), which was kept constant (25 °C) in our study, but greater thermal extremes may be neededfor species to evolve elevated Hsp expression (Willot et al. 2017). On theother hand, graded protection allows for pre-emptive Hsp expression byelevating expression at the lower end of the temperature gradient when the expressionrate is slower. Interestingly, slower expression rate also results in lowerexpression values before reaching maximum expression levels (Fig 1). However,colonies with higher Ctmax compensate by simultaneously elevating maximumexpression to add greater repair at lethal temperatures. Because Hsps act as asensor for protein denaturation (Richter et al. 2010; Craig and Gross 1991), enhancedtolerance (Tm) suggests that the whole proteome is robust to denaturing forspecies in open canopy forests. Very few amino acid changes are needed toevolve greater protein stability (Somero 2004; Lockwood and Somero 2012),however, these changes need to be distributed across many proteins across thewhole proteome (Field 2001). Another route to greater protein stabilityinvolves changing osmolytes and their concentrations to enable higher meltingtemperatures across all proteins (Stillman and Somero 2001).

**Objective:** Interesting paper where these authors wanted to understand the role of hsp70 in the ion homeostasis of neurons. 

**Hypothesis:** Hsp70 help maintain K+ ion balance in the brain

**Methods:** To test for the role of hsp70, they began by manipulating fruit flies by treating them with ouabain, which caused loss of electrical activity in neurons. Ouabain is an inhibitor of Na/K ATPase pump.K gets pumped into cells, and NA gets pumped out. So if it is inhibited, K+ will accumulate outside of cells.  Another way they disrupted ion balance was that they put the flies under anoxic conditions (by $N_2$ gas). Their main read out was K+ outside of the cells. Then they measured hsp70 expression in the brain. 

**Results:** Their oubain treatment worked. In hsp70 null background, there were more surges (K+ spikes). The surges were less when Hsp70 was induced in the brain relative to controls.

A little tidbit I wrote up that ended up not fitting in with the paragraph:

I couldn't fix it so I took it out, but it has good ideas and refs.




 <u>Interesting paper that compares the metabolome under different stressors:</u> 


ref:   Robert Michaud M, Benoit JB, Lopez-Martinez G *et al.* (2008) Metabolomics reveals unique and shared metabolic changes in response to heat shock, freezing and desiccation in the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica. *Journal of Insect Physiology*, **54**, 645–655.

They measured the metabolome of antarctic midge under desiccation, heat shock, cold shock, and controls. The clustering looks like (newick format):

(desiccation,(cold,(control,heat)))




 <u>last paragraph of dissertation conclusion:</u> 


oberg or pelini paper on ctmax and water weight figure suggests that there is a trade off in 1 subfamily but not another.

cool idea to measure adaptive potential or trade offs between stressors across a whole clade. 

also need to understand how the environment influences thermal experiences

### Page 50: 2017-03-17. Writing notes  




For the conclusion of my thesis, my thoughts are a little scattered. I took this part out:

> Not only can the HSF-HSE cascade participate in responding to heat stress, but also it appears to be important for development (Gonsalves et al. 2011; Li et al. 2016) and may be critical for otherbiological processes. HSF-HSE binding is associated with transcriptionally active regions that are independent of bound chromatin locations under heat shock (Li et al. 2016), suggesting that the HSF has additional function outside the HSR. In fact, HSF binding can co-localize with the E2F transcription factor, which is known to permit development in insects and is influenced by nutritional stress (Britton and Edgar 1998). It is possible for social insects to utilize the cooperation between HSF and E2F to produce alternative reproductive phenotypes, which are in large part driven by environmental cues (Smith et al. 2008). If stressors besides temperature alter the chromatin structure to enforce a closed (heterochromatin) state to deny HSF-HSE binding. Therefore, even if proteins become unfolded under desiccation or starvation,Hsp may not be able to become induced which may explain the cross-susceptibility to coping with heat stress. 

Hard to fit this in. 



For my hsp rxn discussion, I need to rewrite it, starting with a re-outline for each paragraph:

First part: Focus on CTmax

1. Summary of findings for CTmax and forest types, evolutionary transitions
2. How forest types alter the thermal experiences and in turn, selective regimes. But I need to tie this back to clinal vaariation that I found too
3. Flat woods forests—SHC had problems with examples at the end. Hmmm tie back to selective regimes?



Second part: Focus on hsp rxn norms

4. The transition into flat woods and increase in CTmax were accompanied by dynamic changes in Hsp expression profiles that were captured with a function-valued approach. 

   * function valued approach allowed for novel approach to quantify different strategies for hsp expression that correlate with upper thermal limits 
   * THis is a novel approach over traditional comparisons of typical constitutive and induced expression because
   * Hsp parameters can evolve separately, but the first pc explained 40% of the variation in CTmax

   - give overall relationship, slower expression rate, higher Tm and higher maximum values
   - hsp paramters explained 40% of the variation
   - Furthermore, these parameters can evolve independently

5. Active part of Hsps

   * induced instead of constitutive proteciton, simply by altering expression rate
     * may not be the most important mechanism
     * interestingly, slower expression rate causes higher expression at the low end of the gradient, but lower expression at the higher end of the gradient before reaching max expression values.
   * Instead higher expression or enhanced response shows investment into active repair for flat woods forests species

6. Passive parts of Hsps: 

   * hsps are sensors and the higher onset of induction suggests they can resist protein unfolding
   * ​

7. Conclusion: 



Taking out a part, has good ideas, but poorly organized:



> Hsps expression responds to the thermal sensitivities of enzyme kinetics (Dahlhoff
> and Rank 2000) and protein aggregation (Willot et al. 2016). Very few amino
> acid changes are needed to evolve greater protein stability (Somero
> 2004;Lockwood and Somero 2012) and are enriched in charged amino acids (Leuenberger
> et al. 2017). However, amino acid changes need to be distributed across many
> proteins across the whole proteome (Field 2001), which is extremely difficult
> because many mutations are deleterious and requires high mutation rates. A more
> attainable route to greater proteome stability involves increasing osmolytes
> that which can non-specifically extend melting temperatures across all proteins
> (Stillman and Somero 2001). For example, trehalose is known to act as a

Some more writing notes: basically stuff I'm taking out of my discussion.

### Page 52: 2017-03-21. Writing notes       


The part that the reviewer wanted me to take out in my discussion because it was too fruit fly focused in my first paper (Nguyen et al. 2016; *BMC Evo Biol*)

>Among different species of *Drosophila*, the primacy of *hsp70*'s role in the heat shock response is
>achieved through an evolutionary increase in copy number from 2 to 5 [16,20]. We
>detected minimal copy number variation in either *hsp83* or *hsc70*, although
>it is important to note that lack of detailed manual annotation of non-*Drosophila* genomes may make it difficult
>to detect highly similar copies should they be present.  Nevertheless, this suggests that Hymenopteran
>(and other insect) Hsps may be recruited to the heat shock response primarily through
>expansions in cis-regulatory HSEs across the entire promoter region, along with
>transcriptional enhancement associated with introns that are lacking in *D. melanogaster *(Additional files 7-8: Figures
>S4-5)[23-25,54-55]. 

**Hsp rxn norm paper**

Took this out of my discussion, couldn't fit it in...

> Broadly in ants, the divergence in upper thermal limits is associated with open to forested habitats and nesting locations (Diamond et al. 2012). However, within our study, we were able to recover divergence in upper thermal limits within forest types that differ in canopy cover. 

Part of discussion I'm saving:

> Acclimation temperature in natural populations change within a season and Hsps are known to track seasonal fluctuations (Dietz and Somero 2004; Banerjee et al. 2014).             



Another part: This is at the end of the proteome stability part

> Therelative contribution of all of these mechanisms are unknown and typically
> studied in isolation. Nonetheless, resisting heat stress as inferred from the
> onset of Hsp induction appears to be a critical feature of Hsp expression
> profiles that is associated with shifts in upper thermal limits.

Maybe I don't even want to pop off on how proteomes can be stable:

> Higher proteome stability can be achieved by expressing more thermally stable isoforms (Mastrangelo et al. 2012), protein-protein interactions (Storey and Wu 2013), accumulation of protective osmolytes (Hottiger et al. 1994; Somero 2003), and evolved differences in amino acid sequence (Lockwood[ and Somero 2012; Fields et al. 2015). 



SHC comments and outline for discussion: 

> - Primarymode of action of Hsps is enhanced response to damage – how much more?  
>
> - Butalso evidence that more heat-tolerant species are better able to toleratethermal stress through other means: protein sequence evolution, osmolyteconcentrations, metabolic depression and gene expression downregulation(Stanton-Geddes).  Because Hsps areexpensive, the more frequent the heat stress, the more costly active responseis.  
>
> - Protectionless important contributor to higher thermal tolerance.  Protection is usually thought of in terms ofbaseline levels, but important to remember that this can also be achievedthrough the induction response via graded or early-onset protection.  Shift to a more graded response suggests achange in trigger of Hsp gene expression (from direct feedback from denaturedproteins to some other temperature sensor – something like HSR1 non-codingRNA?)
>
> - Studyof extreme thermophiles suggests a shift from induced to constitutiveprotection, but this may not be representative of evolved thermal strategies inseasonal environments (or less extreme? Or non-desert?).  Probably not the case that the elevation isoccurring in genes other than the ones sampled here – positive associationbetween inducibility and baseline elevation in hot—desert vs. temperate antcomparison (other literature on the likelihood that non-inducible forms areinvolved in heat-associated chaperoning?) . Why not?  Energetically costly andretards enzyme activity, slowing growth. Most useful when stress is chronic or predictable – typical of speciesliving in predictably extreme environments such as hot deserts (in ants:  Pogonomyrmex and Cataglyphis, desert flies,other taxa).  For temperate species,stress is predictable on timescales that are shorter than the individual’slifetime, making baseline shifts more profitable as a plastic acclimationstrategy.  Evidence that this is whatoccurs in Aphaenogaster (JCB paper), loads of other literature on seasonalacclimation.

### Page 53: 2017-03-22. Prepping for oral defense, reading notes 

Submitted thesis to committee. What types of questions will I get for my defense? 



1. What types of mechanisms increase proteome stability? Why does a proteome need to be stable? 

ref:   Fields PA (2001) Review: Protein function at thermal extremes: balancing stability and flexibility. *Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology*, **129**, 417–431.

> Stability is needed to ensure the appropriate geometry for ligand binding, as well as to avoid denaturation, while flexibility is necessary to allow catalysis at a metabolically appropriate rate

a. A stable protein is needed to bind a substrate but also not unfold and aggregate. 

b. Flexibilty is needed for catalysis because it involves domains in the protein to move. 

Stability is defined as the distribution of microstates considered to be in the native form—not sure I like this definition



2. What facilitates protein folding?
   * Hsps 
   * protein-solvant interactions
   * it is a challenge to refold proteins because the number of microstates outnumbers the atoms in the universe
   * hydrophobic effect—non-polar residues are usually in the interior of globular proteins

3. How far do Aphaenogaster migrate? 
   * deciduous forest ones move around a lot, but less than 1 meter
   * ​

4. Across the whole clade, is there evidence for phylogenetic niche conservatism?
   * potentially, the western clade is a bit reversed. There is more diversity in open canopy species and 1 or 2 closed canopy species. 

5. What is the geographical history of NA Aphaenogaster?
   * There is evidence for a diversification event from asia to na. A. japonica is loacted in japan and is sister to all of NA aphaenogaster species and this split occurred ~ 16 may, roughly the same timing as the bering strait. 
   * Part of the Stenamini tribe, and Myrmecine subfamily
   * Genus is polyphyletic and needs to include Messor.

6. What about membrane stability? 
   * Adaptive to shift phospholipid head groups, enrich for PC and lipid saturation to confer stability
   * Under heat stress, lipids melt and become more fluid like, so organisms respond by becoming more rigid

   ​

   ​

   2017-3-24 cont'd:

7. What can pass through a lipid bilayer(pure)? 

   * Things that can pass
     * hydrophobic molecules such as gas, steroids
     * small uncharged polar molecules: urea, water, glycerol, ethanol
   * Things that CANT pass
     * Large uncharged polar molecules: sugars
     * Ions cannot pass (NA+, K+, H+, CA2+)
       * In active transport: 3 NA+ goes out, 2 K+ goes in and produces a negative membrane potential
       * ​

### Page 56: 2017-03-28.  Definition of phenotypic plasticity  and general paper reading   

Scheiner 1993; *Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics*

  Scheiner SM (1993) Genetics and Evolution of Phenotypic Plasticity. *Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics*, **24**, 35–68.

Scheiner defines phenotypic plasticity as the general effect of the environment on phenptypes, including when the effect is 0. 

One way to represent phenotypic plasticity is a *norm of reaction* or *reaction norm*. He refers to the reaction norm as the specific form of that(environmental) effect. These terms can be interchangable he argues. Plasticity itself is the specific change in a trait with respect to the environment, regardless of the genotype. 

Angilletta 2009 defines plasticity as the derivative of a reaction norm. He cites a good reference for how plasticity is defined: Debat and David 2001. 

ref: Debat V, David P (2001) Mapping phenotypes: canalization, plasticity and developmental stability. Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 16, 555–561.


I like this quote:    

> The relationship between genotype and phenotype is not one to one.

Hard to understand:   
> This duality is the basis of ‘genetic assimilation’, the process by which a response to unusual environments can be converted by selection into a permanent, genetically determined, phenotypic change.

The response can be genetic itself. Poor definition. I'd define genetic assimilation as the evolution of a plastic response into a fixed one.   

Wow, this dude named Woltereck made up the term "reaction norm" in 1909.     

Definitions of plasticity from this paper:

1. Bradshaw 1965: Plasticity is shown by a genotype when its expression is able to be atlered by environmental influences. This may or many not be adaptive.    

other definitions are junk. They don't include Scheiner into this paper...what the....


### Making sense of JSG's paper:   

JSG discusses 3 potential mechanisms of temperature adaptation that is mediated by the transcriptome:   

1. Enhanced response hypothesis    
* Inducing a stronger transcriptional response to provide protection.    
  * Prediction: cool adapted species strongly upregulate genes at low temperature and down regulate at higher temps

2. Tolerance hypothesis     
* Not really framed as a hypothesis....

> proposes that existing inducible stress responses become insufficient or prohibitively costly as environmental stressors increase in frequency, resulting in a shift away from induced response in favor of structural changes    

What the...does this mean? 

	* I think the hypothesis is this: A shift away from induced response in favor of structural changes.  Makes no sense to me...    
	* This hypothesis predicts adaptation to stress to be associated with lower transcriptional responsiveness and less sensitivity to temperature perturbations. 
	*  I'd describe this as resistance.   

3. Genetic Assimilation hypothesis 
* Selection shifts inducible expression to constitutive expression of stress related genes.

Adding notes from JPreston and Blockwood for Hsp rxn norm chapter.

<u>JP:</u>

*In contrast, increases in the inflection point indicates later onset of protein damage (stress resistance; Fig. 1C*

> Does this mean there is another mechanism that stops protein damage at moderate temperatures OR that Hsps can evolve to bemore potent at lower levels?

*If thermal tolerance is achieved via greater responsiveness to protein damage, this should be reflected in higher peak expression levels….*

> **To test this don't you need to know how muchprotein damage there is? What if protein damage is the same between two speciesat a moderate temperature, but one of the species (the more tolerant species) takes longer to ramp up Hsps? Doesn't this mean that the tolerant species is less responsive to protein damage at least at moderate temperatures?

I'll add Brent's later.

<u>Blockwood:</u>

For the intro

2nd paragraph in intro

> It would be good to include a statement and reference to studies that justify the protective effect of the HSR *in vivo*, i.e. Welte, et al. 1993, Feder et al. 1995, etc. wherein Hsp over expression was engineered with transgenic constructs and increases in whole-organism heat tolerance were measured. This is important because many in the field are confused by thinking of the HSR as a “stress” response and thus see Hsps as bioindicators of stress rather than the protective molecular “heroes” that they are. 

3rd paragraph in intro:

> You need to cite Brian Bettencourt’s work. He tracked alleles of Hsp70 that corresponded to high and low expression in the Australian Drosophila. So, you could probably say something more than just “currently unclear” because we do know something about natural populations. There’s also the copepod work out of Ron Burton’s lab that has done quite a lot to address this question in recent years.

In response to:

*Hsp gene expression usuallyfollows a non-linear, logistic function (Kingsolver & Woods 2016);...*

> Is this really the only reference for this statement? Is this based off of insects only? Or do they cite more broadly into the marine literature? One of the best references for timecourse of hsp expression is Buckley and Somero 2006

For the discussion

> Two major considerations: First, I think you need a set of statements about other mechanisms of thermal tolerance. Your hsp expression explains 40% of the variation, but what about the other 60%? It’s not all about proteins. This is particularly an important consideration for anyone who appreciates the physiology that underlies CTmax, which likely has a neural (membrane) basis. Further, for aerobic eukaryotes, the membranes of the mitochondria are an important factor. This sort of relates to the OCCLT hypothesis by Portner too. Check out Dahlhoff and Somero 1991 (abalone mitochondria) as well as Stillman and Somero 1999 (porcelain crab heat tolerance). Second, you should briefly discuss the obvious alternative
> hypothesis that the evolution of CTmax may not have accompanied or been driven
> by the colonization of different habitats, but rather the species had different
> CTmax prior to sorting themselves based on their thermal preferences.

### PCR purify amplicons    

Used Qiagen pcr purify kit according to manufacturer's instructions:

1. took 20 uL of amplicon and added 100 uL (5 vol) of PB buffer    
2. Transferred to column, spun top speed 1 min   
3. wash with PE buffer 750 uL, spin top speed 1 min
4. Spin again, top speed 1 min
5. Place column in new tubes (with labels) and elute
6. Eluted by adding 30 uL h20 into center of column and waiting 1 min; spun top speed 1 min

### qPCR     

Set up hsp70, hsp40, and hsp83 qpcr plates. I made master mix for 100 rxns:

Loaded 6 uL master mix into plate and then added 4 uL of template (DNA).    

Loaded dilutions for each species H-A. Each species is a row.   


* qpcr steps   
  1. 95 C, 10 minutes     
  2. 40 cycles of: 95 C for 15s, 55 C for 60 seconds and then 70 C for fluorescence acquisition,         

* Melt curve analysis    
  1. Reactions were heated to 95C 15 s    
  2. From 60 C, slowly heat up and measure fluoresence   
  

### Results: Hsp70    

**0.5 fluoresence threshold**

It looks like the dilution didn't work for crematogaster and floridana (Fb1). I didn't mix well for initial 1:10 dilution.

I still need to run hsp40 and hsp83.
