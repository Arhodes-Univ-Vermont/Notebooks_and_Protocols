**Introduction:**    
Notebook for 2017 new year. It'll log the rest of my dissertation and potentially new post doc ideas and/or projects

## List of projects and description   
* Hsp rxn norm: Understanding how the local thermal environment shapes thermal tolerance and stress response (using Hsps as a proxy for stress) in forest ants of the genus *Aphaenogaster*. CTmax and rxn norm of Hsp expression measured across forest ants from Fl to Maine.   
* Range limits: Identifying the factors/forces that set range limits in common forest ants (*Aphaenogaster picea*). Modelling + measured their cold physiology in forest ants of Maine and Vt.  
* Multiple stressors: Understanding how progressive desiccation and starvation impacts thermal tolerances in *A. picea*. We pre-treated with desiccation and starvation and then measured KO-time. We also measured the stress response.        
* Thermal niche paper: Collaborative paper understanding how the environment shapes the ability to withstand cold and hot temperatures. In field and in a common garden, we measured upper and lower thermal limits of ants from GA-Maine (2 species).    
* Stress in nature: Are ants stressed under experimental warming that projects climate change? Ants were collected from warming chambers (0-5 C increase from ambient) and we measured their stress response.

### Page 5: 2017-01-17. Project idea: The impact of temperature variation on ant colonly level performance.     

**Background**   
Ant colonies experience temperature fluctuations throughout the day and season. In response to temperature variation, ants must be able to forage under cool and hot conditions. One way to achieve high performance in the face of temperature variation is for the colony to match individual level performance with shifting temperatures. For example, for colonies with diverse genetic structures, some genotypes may forage better under cool or hot conditions. Multiply mated queens (*Pogonomyrmex*) will produce offspring with more phenotypic variation in traits, compared to singly mated queens (*Aphaenogaster*).     

**Notes:** Need to actually verify that foraging efficiency differs throughout the day in a colony, aka need to know more natural history. Look up Deborah Gordon's work. How will you address the confounding issue of demographic effects? Meaning what if there is genetic clumping of sperm and it corresponds to age polyethism, leading to the covariance between age and genotype. Also, the age structure of the colony itself may covary with genotype.       

**Question**   

1. Is the amount of physiological variation in upper thermal limits reflected in the number of fathers?    
2. Do ant colonies utilize different genotypes to forage throughout the day and season?    

or

Do ants display seasonal adaptation in forager performance?   

**Hypotheses**  

1. The number of fathers increases the amount of phenotypic variatnce in upper thermal limits.    
2. There is genetic structuring in the foragers throughout the day and season.    

**Predictions**    

1. Additive genetic variance in upper thermal limits will be proportional to the number of fathers.     
2. Thermally tolerant genotypes perform during the warmest parts of the day and vice versa for more cool tolerant genotypes.    
3. The more thermally tolerant genotypes start off at low frequency early on in the season, but increase in frequency at peak summer, then decrease again.    

**Experimental Design**   

I should do a power analysis to see how many ants and colonies I'd need to sample. Sam Scarpino has an R package for this I think.   

1. Document the natural history of 10 pogo colonies, to tune for sampling   
2. If there is like 10 foraging bouts, or 10 time slices through the day, sample ~30 ants for each colony at each time slice.   
3. Phenotype each ant: measure morphology (head width, leg lengths, alitrunk length, etc), number of ovarioles?, hydrocarbons, desiccation resistance, measure upper thermal limit   
4. Pool ants at each time slice, isolate DNA, and then pool-seq (capture-seq, but chatting with April, it sounds like biased sampling because only the portion of the first exon and promoter are sequenced.)     

**Critical Results or Alternative outcomes**  

1. Positive relationship between parentage and phenotypic variance.    
2. Structuring of alleles throughout the day or season. Some start off low, increase, then decrease in frequence.  This would indicate seasonal adaptation of foragers!     

It is possible that we won't find anything at all. But maybe because we're pool-sequencing, we can pick up the microbiome? And maybe that is structured diurnally or throughout the season.    

### Another idea: Compare parasite load between ant colonies with high and low number of fathers.  

Quick and dirty: One of the benefits of a diverse genetic background in a colony is disease resistance. So, test this by pool-seq experiment and measuring the parasite loads for ~30 individuals, potentially across a whole phylogeny of ants that vary in number of daddys and number of queens. Parasite load from different taxanomic groups (fungus, nemotodes, bacteria, viruses) can be mapped onto the phylogeny!

### Page 7: 2017-01-19. Making sense of reviewer comment; multiple stressors ms   

**Is there any direct evidence that heat shock proteins prevent heat knockdown?**    

Calabria et al. 2012 find differences in basal hsp70 protein expression but not heat-induced hsp70 expression between 3 genotypes of fruit flies( they differ in chromosomal structure). These differences were reflected in the fast ramp (0.1 C/min ramp), but not slow ramp(0.6 C/min ramping). 

3 genotypes:

1. O(3+4)/O(3+4): higher hsp70 basal expression and thermal tolerance under fast ramp;       
2. O(3+4+8)/O(3+4+8)    
3. O(st)/O(st): lower hsp70 basal expression and thermal tolerance under fast ramp;

### Page 8: 2017-01-19. Notes from SICB    

**2017-01-05; Met with Joel Kingsolver**    

Met and talked about range limits project, selection gradient idea, and hsp rxn norm gxp project.      
* For my ancestral trait reconstruction of CTmax, I excluded the outgroup, suggests to include it      
* For multi-panel figure with parameters on x axis and ctmax on y axis; try partial regression      
* If I don't get into PNAS, try Proc B    
* For looking at shifts in trade-offs between multiple stressors look up Nancy Emory, central cali, she is a plant evo ecologist   
* Selection gradient proj idea; JK asks what has been done in well known systems? ie. Arapidopsis (sp?), check Andy Schidth   

**2017-01-06; met with Ray Huey**    

Showed hsp rxn norm paper stuff:     
* Are parameters correlated- he was worrieda bout this.    
* Try fitting splines and extracting parameters     
* Selection on graits; linear or quadratic? non-parametric?       

**2017-01-07 Met with Dan Hahn and Greg Ragland**      

Went over data and Dan liked how Iparsed out all the predictions for the shifts in reaction norms of hsp gxp expression.    
* Finger example highlights the differences between resistance and tolerance    
* Pressing two fingers together without moving = **resistance**       
* When 1 finger moves the other finger but can move back = **tolerance**

Starting off intro with constraints on upper thermal limits. 



**What can constraint upper thermal limits?**

1. low plasticity (stillmann paper shows this in crabs)
2. low adaptive potential (heritability)   
   * low variation in upper compared to lower thermal limits
3. Phylogenetic constraints inferred from strong phylogenetic signal. 
   * high lambda in PGLS for insects, lizards + snakes  

Some definitions: 

* heritability: degree of phenotypic variation in a trait that is genetic 
* evolvability: extent to which the trait's mean can shift under selection, which depends on the amount of genetic variation and mean values.  

Paper argues that mid-latitude species are most prone to heat stress (presently and to the future). Why? And what is mid-latitude?

### Page 11: 2017-01-26. Notes on teaching statements   

This science [article](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2006/04/writing-teaching-statement) has interesting advice. The teaching statement is usually a writing filter to weed out applicants who have not thought stuff through. Illuminates the character of the writer. It should be 1-2 pages. 



1. **Cater teaching statement to the institution**
2. **Demonstrate a real commitment to teaching** 
   * Low expectations on unique ways of teaching, but just show commitment (usually a sentence or two)
   * cite evidence, but be brief
3. Avoid presenting teaching as a 2nd priority
4. *Show us you care, but make it short and to the point* 
5. echo teachign interests in the cover letter, 1-2 sentences
6. Write about courses you'd like to teach!  For me, it'd be evolutionary physiology, evolution, computational biology?, ecological genomics 
   * cater this to the institution
   * display ideas, but don't be too ambitious
7. Teaching statement also indicates to the search committee how the applicant sees themselves in 
   * don't limit yourself to advanced courses, but also include beginners!
8. Display willingness to learn, pay attention, and change to reflect open mindedness and eagerness; shows you're not limited by what you are now
9. **Draw on your experieences as a student, a scholar, and human being** 
10. Don't promise too much

A good quote: 

`I used to assume that any student who did not get an "A" on an exam wasn't trying, until it occurred to me that no matter how hard I try in dance classes, I rarely excel. Becoming less critical of my students--while still maintaining high standards--has made me a better teacher.`

**Correlated response to selection for stress resistance.** 



Fruit fly paper doing a selection experiment on: 

1. cold (CS) in units of survival rate
   * chilled 5 C, recover 24 hours
2. heat (HS) in units of survival rate
   * hardened 30 min at 36C, recover 20 hours at 25 C, then heat shocked 38C 1 hour
3. desiccation (DS)
4. starvation (SS)
5. Heat knockdown time (KS) -in units of time (minutes)
   * KO at 40C
6. Lifespan (LS)

* And then they checked all of the traits from each selected line relative to controls. 
* 21 generations



1. Cold shock resistance (CS)
   * CS, HS, and DS all increased
2. Heat shock resistance (HS)
   * HS, KS, DS all responded
3. Heat knockdown resistance  (KS)
   * only KS responded

KS and SS increased developmental time. 



Upper and lower thermal limits can equally respond to selection after X generations in fruit flies. IN this experiment, there isn't necessarily a trade off betwween the two (except in cold shock resistance).

### Page 14: 2017-01-26. Mitchell & Hoffmann 2010, Functional Ecology; Thermal ramping influences evolutionary potential

In fruit flies, they measured upper thermal limits as knockdown time in a static and ramping experiment. They did this in  a quantitative genetic design, so they could estimate the narrow-sense heritability (partition out variation to the additive genetic component).  They also measured this for ~11 species.  (looks like a lot of work)



**Methods:**

Slow ramp: 0.06 C/min

Fast, static HS: 38C preset temp



Fast and slow show a postive relationship. 



Set up a model to partition out variation Va (additive genetic variance), Vp (phenotypic variance), and Ve (environmental variance) and presented models for their coefficient of variation.



**Results**: 

* Ramping had low heritability(not sig different than 0), but static had high heritability (sig different than 0)
* Ramping had more environmental variance, but do the data need to be standardized first, such that the mean is 0 and variance i 1? No, the units are the same for both traits
* Ramping had higher phenotypic variance



**THoughts**

This paper contrasts a little bit with van Heraawarden & Sgrò paper, where they focus one 1 species. But they find that ramping, fast HS, and hardening all significantly correlate. But there is an additive genetic axis where

### Page 15: 2017-01-27. Embedding calender into webpage

[Followed this tutorial](http://denisecase.github.io/2015/07/10/add-calender-to-site/): 

1. Create a  calender in google (gmail)
2. Go to settings
3. click calendars
4. go down to where it says embed this calendar, it is in html code, so copy that
5. tutorial goes through yml, but I just used the html code to make a new webpage with my calender in it and created a link in the navigation bar

[Here it is](https://adnguyen.github.io/calendar.html), useful for me to access my calender wherever I am now!   



### 2017-01-31 Update  

Calendar doesn't show up on my iphone or ipad (safari), what is the point? Taking the calendar out.

### Page 16: 2017-01-31. Sørensen et al. 2003; Ecology letters, The Evolutionary and ecological role of heat shock proteins

Trying to get a handle on how this paper frames the role of Hsps with upper thermal limits. From the abstract, they mention it as a resistance mechanism. 



1. **Defining stress:**  a condition that disturbs the normal function of the biological system or a condition that decreases fitness (Hoffmann & Parsons 1991; Bijlsma & Loeschcke 1997)
   * I like part of the definition. I'd define stress **as a perturbation to a biological system that decreases fitness.** Or, a force acting on a biological system that decreases fitness. 
   * These forces can be *extrinsic* (environmental) and *intrinsic* (genetics, inbreeding, deleterious mutations, ageing).


2. **Hsp natural history** (cite Ritossa 1962 as first discovering heat shock response through chromosome puffs(which had Hsps on it))
3. **Protein quality control system (PQC)**: importance increases upon exposrue to environmental /genetic stresses
   * function is 2 fold: correct folding and to assist in degradation of denatured or aggregated proteins
   * not very informative
4. Stress as an ecoogical and evo force (Don't agree with the framing)
   * types of responses:
     * move, alter physiological state through hibernation or diapause
     * adapt or acclimate
     * fail and die
   * Adaptive change in Hsp over days (Nguyen et al. 1994; Ferguson et al. 1998) or over seasons (Fader et al. 1994; Hofmann & Somero 1995; Pyza et al. 1997; Miner et al. 2000) and natural populations(no citations, what?)
5. Effects of stress on rates of evolution
   * ​
6. **Costs of Hsp expression**
   * unclear whether reduced fitness is due to cost of acclimation or reared under poor conditions. Why would we tease these apart? 
   * Benefits of acclimation (stress /longevity) can be separated from costs
     * ex: Hercus et al. 2003: repeated mild stress lowered fertility and fecundity in the short term but not long term
     * One way to separte out costs and benefits is by altering acclimation treatments (Scott et al. 1997; Hoffmann & HewaKapuge 2000; Thomson et al. 2001; Wilson & Franklin 2002)
   * lowers fertility fecundity, energy, development, and survival 
   * Direct costs measured by Krebs & Feder 1998: hardened flies at different stages (1-3rd instar) in 4isofemale lines. Multiple heat exposures reduced survival but did not affect development time. Expression of Hsp70 was not correlated with survival, suggesting differences in expression cannot explain survival effects. 
   * said this already but high hsps lower growth and cell division (Feder et al. 1992; Krebs & Feder 1997, reduced reproduction (Krebs & Loeschcke 1994; Silbermann & Tatar 2000))
     * Silbermann & Tatar 2000 showed heat induced hsp expression reduced egg hatching of moms in fruit flies. 
     * Krebs & Loeschcke 1994 found reduced fecundity
7. **The role of Hsps for adaptation** 
   * Improved heat resistance of insects after hsp expression in **insects** ( (Gehring & Wehner 1995; Dahlgaard et al. 1998), **fish**(Basu et al. 2002) , plants (Sun et al. 2002), **mammals** (Ulmasov et al. 1993; Matz
     et al. 1996a). 
   * Some of the first data on the possible ecological relevance of Hsp expression comes from selection studies. In
     different species of Drosophila, it was shown that (contrary to predictions at that time) expression of Hsp70 was lower in lines frequently, or continuously exposed to severe stress (Bettencourt et al. 1999; Sørensen et al. 1999; Lansing et al 2000)
     * interpretation = costs of Hsp in pops exposed to stress outweighs benefits and adaptation is achieved through some other means
   * Density dependence might drive hsp expression 
   * Age will influence hsp expression
   * Life stages may differe in stressors exposed
     * Stage specific Hsp expression and resistance - no citation
     * not much support (Sørensen et al. 1999)
   * In adults, Hsp70 down regulated with decreasing heat stress resistance (Sørensen & Loeschcke 2002a)
8. **Conclusions and future prospectives**
   * ```However, new results show that Hsp expression is highly fine-tuned (not being only an on–off mechanism) and that Hsps are also continuously expressed after mild chronic stress exposure.```
   * Hsps as biomarkers of stress
   * ```However, local adaptation and selection for other kinds of adaptive mechanisms may disturb the evaluation of the results. The results by Sørensen et al. (1999, 2001) and Ko¨hler et al. (2000) showing that there is selection against Hsp expression in populations being exposed to chronic stress clearly demonstrates this problem.```

### Overall thoughts:

Not very informative in terms of what Hsps are actually doing and how they relate to upper thermal limits. What is the difference between protection and resistance? Tolerance? Some consistent wording would be nice. The paper focused too much on costs and benefits rather than adaptive variation. This is nice to know but what aspect of the thermal ecology do Hsps relate to? I would have hoped there would be a better discussion fo basal vs induced hsps.

### Page 18: 2017-01-31. Status of projects: writing

1. Project updates:    
   - **Hsp gene expression + Ctmax project:**
     - Met with NJG yesterday, revised intro, reread, should be ready to review with NJG 2017-02-06; Monday
     - Meeting with NJG 2017-02-03, Friday 1PM to go over results, figure legends, figures. 
     - Submit to PNAS in May?   
   - **Multiple stressors ms:**   
     - ==In SHC's hands, due 2017-02-14==
   - **Range limits ms**: SHC lab gave verbal edit, still need to incorporate     
     - **Thermal niche ms:** Lacy to check intro, and add refs.    	
   - **Stressed in nature MS: Samples to rerun.**       
     - **There are 74 samples: 3 days of RNA isolation + cDNA synthesis. 4 gene targets ran in duplicates is 2 plates per gene = 8 plates total.  2 days for 8 plates.**           
   - **Proteome stability project:**

### Page 19: 2017-01-31. SHC lab meeting reading: Ranga et al. 2017; Evol Ecol: Sibling Drosophila species (Drosophila leontia and Drosophila kikkawai) show divergence for thermotolerance along a latitudinal gradient

This study compares the different aspects of lower and upper thermal limits between two closely related species (*Drosophila*) in India across a wide climate gradient (8 -32 degrees north): 

1. *D. leontia*
2. *D. kikkawai*

==Measurements:==

1. **Upper thermal limits**
   * Heat knockdown time: 39 C treatment in water bath, measured time where they could not stand
   * Survival: 24 hour survey of flies 100% dead when treated at 39C over time (10-80min)
   * Hardening:
2. **Lower thermal limits**
   * Chill coma recovery time
     * 0C treatment for 8 hour then recover at room temp (22C); measured time they could stand upright
   * Cold survival 
     * 0 C treatment for 8 -96 hours, measured survival after 24hours
3. **Absolute hardening capacity (AHC)**
   * AHC = KT - C 
   * KT = thermotolerance after hardening
     * warm: (33, 35 or 37 C)
     * cool: (0, 2 or 4 C)
   * C = basal thermo-tolerance
4. **Relative hardening capacity**
   * RHC = (KT – C)/C
5. **Egg-to-adult viability**
   * Hot: eggs subected to 39 C 1 hour
   * Cold: eggs subjected to 0 C 12 hours
   * transferred to 22C 65% RH

## Results 

(Fig 2)

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * Clinal variation in Upper thermal limits (KD time, heat survival)
     * No benefit from hardening
   * No clinal variation in lower thermal limits ( CCRT, cold survival)
     * No benefit from hardening
2. *D. kikkawai* —==higher plasticity==
   * Clinal variation in Upper thermal limits (KD time, heat survival)
     - Benefit from hardening
   * Clinal variation in lower thermal limits ( CCRT, cold survival)
     - Benefit from hardening

Table 2: They did anova for each trait, testing the effect of each population

Why not do an ANCOVA:

```R
aov(Thermal trait~ Latitude * Species)
```



**Fig 3: Egg-to-Adult viability**

1. *D. leontia ==lower plasticity==*
   * Southern pop had higher viability under controls, heat stressed, but not cold stress. 
   * **Notes** *makes sense because they have no relationship to cold* 
   * ​
2. *D. kikkawai ==higher plasticity==*
   * Southern pop had higher viability under heat stress but lower under controls and cold stress.

**Fig 4: Mortality**

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * **HS:** No diff in mortality between hardening and controsl (consistent with fig 2)
   * **HS:** Southern had lower mortality  than north
   * **CS:** No diff between hardening and controls and pops
2. *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity==
   * **HS** higher mortality in control than hardened, makes sense; southern has lower mortality
   * **CS:**  Northern have lower mortality than south ; hardening has lower mortality

**Fig 5: AHC (Absolute hardening capacity) and RHC relative hardening capacity**: Same direction

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * no sig hardening between northern and southern pops
2. *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity==
   * Upper thermal limits: positive plasticity
     * Northern pops have higher upper thermal limits
   * Lower thermal limits: 
     * CCRT: northern have faster recovery time
     * survival: northern have higher survival



**Fig 6: Hardening vs pretreatment temperatures**

1. Upper thermal limits:
   * *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity== had higher hardening than *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity== for both KD time and survival
2. Lower thermal limits: 
   * *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity==  has higher cold tolerance than *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==

**Fig 7 looks the same, wtf**



**Figure 8** Focus on the climate variables each species experiences 

- North is more variable, south less variable (A)
- Tave and RH negatively related to latitude

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * higher abundance at the warm end
2. *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity== 
   * higher abundance at the cold end 

## Thoughts 

* What is the demographic history? I ask because it can explain some of the results. 


* Optimal temp for D. leontia is the south and D. kikkawai is in the north. So D. leontia could be moving south to north and D. kikkawai could be moving north to south. 
* Painful read, could have analyzed the data differently.

### Page 21: 2017-02-03. Todgham et al. 2017; JEB, The effect of temperature adaptation on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in notothenioid fishes

Ref: Todgham AE, Crombie TA, Hofmann GE. 2016. The effect of temperature adaptation on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in notothenioid fishes. The Journal of Experimental Biology:jeb.145946.



**Background**

Ubiquitin tags proteins for degradation through the proteasome(protein chomper). In the face of heat stress, different species can adaptively modulate this pathway to cope with the deleterious effects of protein damage. <u>Antarctic species live in -1.9C while new zealand species live in 10C .</u>



**Objective:** Understand the thermal compensation of Ub-proteasome pathway in antarctic fish vs ones form warmer climates.

## Approach and workflow

**Compared ubiquitin ,proteasome activity and expression between 2 tissues (gill and liver) for 4 different fish species.** 

```mermaid

graph TD
A(Trematomus bemacchii) --> D{Antarctic fish}
B(Pagothenia borchgrevinki) --> D

R(Notothenia angustata) --> P{New Zealand}
G(Bovichtus variegatus) --> P

D --> M{Ub-proteasome pathway}
P --> M{Ub-proteasome pathway}
M --> K(Gills)
M --> I(Liver)


K --> W{UB tagging proteins}
K --> E{Proteasome 26s complex}

K --> U[Ub-congugated protein]
I --> U

K --> O[Proteasome activity]
I --> O[Proteasome activity]

W --> T(CHIP)
W --> UbE2D1
W --> Ubiquitin

E --> PSMA2
E --> PSMB7
E --> PSMC1


```

**Figure 1: UB conjugated proteins**

Antarctic and N. angustata have higher ubiquitin tagged proteins than B. variegatus for both liver and gill. 



**FIgure 2. Protasome activity** 

Antactic have higher proteasome activity at 0 and 10 C for both gill and liver. The magnitidue of differences were higher in the gills. This may be why they focused only on the gills for gene expression 



**Figure 3: Gill gxp for UB related genes**

  General pattern as Fig 1. where antarctic fish and N. angustata have higher expression of UB realted gene expression than B. variegatus. But N. angustata had higher expression than the antarctic fish. There could be different dynamics that would be captured with a reaction norm approach. 



**Figure 4: Gil gxn for proteasome complex related genes.** 

Similar result as figure 1. (exxcept top panel) . But here we see categorical differences between Antarctic and new zealand. Antarctic fish have higher expression. 



## Thoughts:

 It looks like cold tolerant species up-regulate their protein degradation pathway. It fits the model that if proteins are too damaged, they're clear those proteins. 



Cool method to test for proteasome activity: (Coux et al., 1996)

1.  chymotrypsin-like activities, which cleaves after large hydrophobic residues
2.  trypsin-like activities, which cleaves after basic residues
3. peptidylglutamylpeptide hydrolyzing activities, which cleaves after acidic residues .
