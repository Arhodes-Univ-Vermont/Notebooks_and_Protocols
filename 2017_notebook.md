###General Lab protocols found [here for heat shocks and RNA related experiments](https://github.com/adnguyen/Dissertation_temperature_adaptation_ants/blob/master/ANBE_protocols.md) and [here for protein related experiments](https://github.com/adnguyen/2016_Protein_stability_evolution/blob/master/Documents/Protocols/Protocols.md).     


**Introduction:**    
Notebook for 2017 new year. It'll log the rest of my dissertation and potentially new post doc ideas and/or projects

## List of projects and description   
* Hsp rxn norm: Understanding how the local thermal environment shapes thermal tolerance and stress response (using Hsps as a proxy for stress) in forest ants of the genus *Aphaenogaster*. CTmax and rxn norm of Hsp expression measured across forest ants from Fl to Maine.   
* Range limits: Identifying the factors/forces that set range limits in common forest ants (*Aphaenogaster picea*). Modelling + measured their cold physiology in forest ants of Maine and Vt.  
* Multiple stressors: Understanding how progressive desiccation and starvation impacts thermal tolerances in *A. picea*. We pre-treated with desiccation and starvation and then measured KO-time. We also measured the stress response.        
* Thermal niche paper: Collaborative paper understanding how the environment shapes the ability to withstand cold and hot temperatures. In field and in a common garden, we measured upper and lower thermal limits of ants from GA-Maine (2 species).    
* Stress in nature: Are ants stressed under experimental warming that projects climate change? Ants were collected from warming chambers (0-5 C increase from ambient) and we measured their stress response.

### Page 5: 2017-01-17. Project idea: The impact of temperature variation on ant colonly level performance.     

**Background**   
Ant colonies experience temperature fluctuations throughout the day and season. In response to temperature variation, ants must be able to forage under cool and hot conditions. One way to achieve high performance in the face of temperature variation is for the colony to match individual level performance with shifting temperatures. For example, for colonies with diverse genetic structures, some genotypes may forage better under cool or hot conditions. Multiply mated queens (*Pogonomyrmex*) will produce offspring with more phenotypic variation in traits, compared to singly mated queens (*Aphaenogaster*).     

**Notes:** Need to actually verify that foraging efficiency differs throughout the day in a colony, aka need to know more natural history. Look up Deborah Gordon's work. How will you address the confounding issue of demographic effects? Meaning what if there is genetic clumping of sperm and it corresponds to age polyethism, leading to the covariance between age and genotype. Also, the age structure of the colony itself may covary with genotype.       

**Question**   

1. Is the amount of physiological variation in upper thermal limits reflected in the number of fathers?    
2. Do ant colonies utilize different genotypes to forage throughout the day and season?    

or

Do ants display seasonal adaptation in forager performance?   

**Hypotheses**  

1. The number of fathers increases the amount of phenotypic variatnce in upper thermal limits.    
2. There is genetic structuring in the foragers throughout the day and season.    

**Predictions**    

1. Additive genetic variance in upper thermal limits will be proportional to the number of fathers.     
2. Thermally tolerant genotypes perform during the warmest parts of the day and vice versa for more cool tolerant genotypes.    
3. The more thermally tolerant genotypes start off at low frequency early on in the season, but increase in frequency at peak summer, then decrease again.    

**Experimental Design**   

I should do a power analysis to see how many ants and colonies I'd need to sample. Sam Scarpino has an R package for this I think.   

1. Document the natural history of 10 pogo colonies, to tune for sampling   
2. If there is like 10 foraging bouts, or 10 time slices through the day, sample ~30 ants for each colony at each time slice.   
3. Phenotype each ant: measure morphology (head width, leg lengths, alitrunk length, etc), number of ovarioles?, hydrocarbons, desiccation resistance, measure upper thermal limit   
4. Pool ants at each time slice, isolate DNA, and then pool-seq (capture-seq, but chatting with April, it sounds like biased sampling because only the portion of the first exon and promoter are sequenced.)     

**Critical Results or Alternative outcomes**  

1. Positive relationship between parentage and phenotypic variance.    
2. Structuring of alleles throughout the day or season. Some start off low, increase, then decrease in frequence.  This would indicate seasonal adaptation of foragers!     

It is possible that we won't find anything at all. But maybe because we're pool-sequencing, we can pick up the microbiome? And maybe that is structured diurnally or throughout the season.    

### Another idea: Compare parasite load between ant colonies with high and low number of fathers.  

Quick and dirty: One of the benefits of a diverse genetic background in a colony is disease resistance. So, test this by pool-seq experiment and measuring the parasite loads for ~30 individuals, potentially across a whole phylogeny of ants that vary in number of daddys and number of queens. Parasite load from different taxanomic groups (fungus, nemotodes, bacteria, viruses) can be mapped onto the phylogeny!

### Page 7: 2017-01-19. Making sense of reviewer comment; multiple stressors ms   

**Is there any direct evidence that heat shock proteins prevent heat knockdown?**    

Calabria et al. 2012 find differences in basal hsp70 protein expression but not heat-induced hsp70 expression between 3 genotypes of fruit flies( they differ in chromosomal structure). These differences were reflected in the fast ramp (0.1 C/min ramp), but not slow ramp(0.6 C/min ramping). 

3 genotypes:

1. O(3+4)/O(3+4): higher hsp70 basal expression and thermal tolerance under fast ramp;       
2. O(3+4+8)/O(3+4+8)    
3. O(st)/O(st): lower hsp70 basal expression and thermal tolerance under fast ramp;

### Page 8: 2017-01-19. Notes from SICB    

**2017-01-05; Met with Joel Kingsolver**    

Met and talked about range limits project, selection gradient idea, and hsp rxn norm gxp project.      
* For my ancestral trait reconstruction of CTmax, I excluded the outgroup, suggests to include it      
* For multi-panel figure with parameters on x axis and ctmax on y axis; try partial regression      
* If I don't get into PNAS, try Proc B    
* For looking at shifts in trade-offs between multiple stressors look up Nancy Emory, central cali, she is a plant evo ecologist   
* Selection gradient proj idea; JK asks what has been done in well known systems? ie. Arapidopsis (sp?), check Andy Schidth   

**2017-01-06; met with Ray Huey**    

Showed hsp rxn norm paper stuff:     
* Are parameters correlated- he was worrieda bout this.    
* Try fitting splines and extracting parameters     
* Selection on graits; linear or quadratic? non-parametric?       

**2017-01-07 Met with Dan Hahn and Greg Ragland**      

Went over data and Dan liked how Iparsed out all the predictions for the shifts in reaction norms of hsp gxp expression.    
* Finger example highlights the differences between resistance and tolerance    
* Pressing two fingers together without moving = **resistance**       
* When 1 finger moves the other finger but can move back = **tolerance**

### Page 10: 2017-01-26. Hoffmann et al. 2013, Functional Ecology Paper notes    

Starting off intro with constraints on upper thermal limits. 



**What can constraint upper thermal limits?**

1. low plasticity (stillmann paper shows this in crabs)
2. low adaptive potential (heritability)   
   * low variation in upper compared to lower thermal limits
3. Phylogenetic constraints inferred from strong phylogenetic signal. 
   * high lambda in PGLS for insects, lizards + snakes  

Some definitions: 

* heritability: degree of phenotypic variation in a trait that is genetic 
* evolvability: extent to which the trait's mean can shift under selection, which depends on the amount of genetic variation and mean values.  

Paper argues that mid-latitude species are most prone to heat stress (presently and to the future). Why? And what is mid-latitude?

### Page 11: 2017-01-26. Notes on teaching statements   

This science [article](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2006/04/writing-teaching-statement) has interesting advice. The teaching statement is usually a writing filter to weed out applicants who have not thought stuff through. Illuminates the character of the writer. It should be 1-2 pages. 



1. **Cater teaching statement to the institution**
2. **Demonstrate a real commitment to teaching** 
   * Low expectations on unique ways of teaching, but just show commitment (usually a sentence or two)
   * cite evidence, but be brief
3. Avoid presenting teaching as a 2nd priority
4. *Show us you care, but make it short and to the point* 
5. echo teachign interests in the cover letter, 1-2 sentences
6. Write about courses you'd like to teach!  For me, it'd be evolutionary physiology, evolution, computational biology?, ecological genomics 
   * cater this to the institution
   * display ideas, but don't be too ambitious
7. Teaching statement also indicates to the search committee how the applicant sees themselves in 
   * don't limit yourself to advanced courses, but also include beginners!
8. Display willingness to learn, pay attention, and change to reflect open mindedness and eagerness; shows you're not limited by what you are now
9. **Draw on your experieences as a student, a scholar, and human being** 
10. Don't promise too much

A good quote: 

`I used to assume that any student who did not get an "A" on an exam wasn't trying, until it occurred to me that no matter how hard I try in dance classes, I rarely excel. Becoming less critical of my students--while still maintaining high standards--has made me a better teacher.`

**Correlated response to selection for stress resistance.** 



Fruit fly paper doing a selection experiment on: 

1. cold (CS) in units of survival rate
   * chilled 5 C, recover 24 hours
2. heat (HS) in units of survival rate
   * hardened 30 min at 36C, recover 20 hours at 25 C, then heat shocked 38C 1 hour
3. desiccation (DS)
4. starvation (SS)
5. Heat knockdown time (KS) -in units of time (minutes)
   * KO at 40C
6. Lifespan (LS)

* And then they checked all of the traits from each selected line relative to controls. 
* 21 generations



1. Cold shock resistance (CS)
   * CS, HS, and DS all increased
2. Heat shock resistance (HS)
   * HS, KS, DS all responded
3. Heat knockdown resistance  (KS)
   * only KS responded

KS and SS increased developmental time. 



Upper and lower thermal limits can equally respond to selection after X generations in fruit flies. IN this experiment, there isn't necessarily a trade off betwween the two (except in cold shock resistance).

### Page 14: 2017-01-26. Mitchell & Hoffmann 2010, Functional Ecology; Thermal ramping influences evolutionary potential

In fruit flies, they measured upper thermal limits as knockdown time in a static and ramping experiment. They did this in  a quantitative genetic design, so they could estimate the narrow-sense heritability (partition out variation to the additive genetic component).  They also measured this for ~11 species.  (looks like a lot of work)



**Methods:**

Slow ramp: 0.06 C/min

Fast, static HS: 38C preset temp



Fast and slow show a postive relationship. 



Set up a model to partition out variation Va (additive genetic variance), Vp (phenotypic variance), and Ve (environmental variance) and presented models for their coefficient of variation.



**Results**: 

* Ramping had low heritability(not sig different than 0), but static had high heritability (sig different than 0)
* Ramping had more environmental variance, but do the data need to be standardized first, such that the mean is 0 and variance i 1? No, the units are the same for both traits
* Ramping had higher phenotypic variance



**THoughts**

This paper contrasts a little bit with van Heraawarden & Sgrò paper, where they focus one 1 species. But they find that ramping, fast HS, and hardening all significantly correlate. But there is an additive genetic axis where

[Followed this tutorial](http://denisecase.github.io/2015/07/10/add-calender-to-site/): 

1. Create a  calender in google (gmail)
2. Go to settings
3. click calendars
4. go down to where it says embed this calendar, it is in html code, so copy that
5. tutorial goes through yml, but I just used the html code to make a new webpage with my calender in it and created a link in the navigation bar

[Here it is](https://adnguyen.github.io/calendar.html), useful for me to access my calender wherever I am now!

### Page 16: 2017-01-31. Sørensen et al. 2003; Ecology letters, The Evolutionary and ecological role of heat shock proteins

Trying to get a handle on how this paper frames the role of Hsps with upper thermal limits. From the abstract, they mention it as a resistance mechanism. 



1. **Defining stress:**  a condition that disturbs the normal function of the biological system or a condition that decreases fitness (Hoffmann & Parsons 1991; Bijlsma & Loeschcke 1997)
   * I like part of the definition. I'd define stress **as a perturbation to a biological system that decreases fitness.** Or, a force acting on a biological system that decreases fitness. 
   * These forces can be *extrinsic* (environmental) and *intrinsic* (genetics, inbreeding, deleterious mutations, ageing).


2. **Hsp natural history** (cite Ritossa 1962 as first discovering heat shock response through chromosome puffs(which had Hsps on it))
3. **Protein quality control system (PQC)**: importance increases upon exposrue to environmental /genetic stresses
   * function is 2 fold: correct folding and to assist in degradation of denatured or aggregated proteins
   * not very informative
4. Stress as an ecoogical and evo force (Don't agree with the framing)
   * types of responses:
     * move, alter physiological state through hibernation or diapause
     * adapt or acclimate
     * fail and die
   * Adaptive change in Hsp over days (Nguyen et al. 1994; Ferguson et al. 1998) or over seasons (Fader et al. 1994; Hofmann & Somero 1995; Pyza et al. 1997; Miner et al. 2000) and natural populations(no citations, what?)
5. Effects of stress on rates of evolution
   * ​
6. **Costs of Hsp expression**
   * unclear whether reduced fitness is due to cost of acclimation or reared under poor conditions. Why would we tease these apart? 
   * Benefits of acclimation (stress /longevity) can be separated from costs
     * ex: Hercus et al. 2003: repeated mild stress lowered fertility and fecundity in the short term but not long term
     * One way to separte out costs and benefits is by altering acclimation treatments (Scott et al. 1997; Hoffmann & HewaKapuge 2000; Thomson et al. 2001; Wilson & Franklin 2002)
   * lowers fertility fecundity, energy, development, and survival 
   * Direct costs measured by Krebs & Feder 1998: hardened flies at different stages (1-3rd instar) in 4isofemale lines. Multiple heat exposures reduced survival but did not affect development time. Expression of Hsp70 was not correlated with survival, suggesting differences in expression cannot explain survival effects. 
   * said this already but high hsps lower growth and cell division (Feder et al. 1992; Krebs & Feder 1997, reduced reproduction (Krebs & Loeschcke 1994; Silbermann & Tatar 2000))
     * Silbermann & Tatar 2000 showed heat induced hsp expression reduced egg hatching of moms in fruit flies. 
     * Krebs & Loeschcke 1994 found reduced fecundity
7. **The role of Hsps for adaptation** 
   * Improved heat resistance of insects after hsp expression in **insects** ( (Gehring & Wehner 1995; Dahlgaard et al. 1998), **fish**(Basu et al. 2002) , plants (Sun et al. 2002), **mammals** (Ulmasov et al. 1993; Matz
     et al. 1996a). 
   * Some of the first data on the possible ecological relevance of Hsp expression comes from selection studies. In
     different species of Drosophila, it was shown that (contrary to predictions at that time) expression of Hsp70 was lower in lines frequently, or continuously exposed to severe stress (Bettencourt et al. 1999; Sørensen et al. 1999; Lansing et al 2000)
     * interpretation = costs of Hsp in pops exposed to stress outweighs benefits and adaptation is achieved through some other means
   * Density dependence might drive hsp expression 
   * Age will influence hsp expression
   * Life stages may differe in stressors exposed
     * Stage specific Hsp expression and resistance - no citation
     * not much support (Sørensen et al. 1999)
   * In adults, Hsp70 down regulated with decreasing heat stress resistance (Sørensen & Loeschcke 2002a)
8. **Conclusions and future prospectives**
   * ```However, new results show that Hsp expression is highly fine-tuned (not being only an on–off mechanism) and that Hsps are also continuously expressed after mild chronic stress exposure.```
   * Hsps as biomarkers of stress
   * ```However, local adaptation and selection for other kinds of adaptive mechanisms may disturb the evaluation of the results. The results by Sørensen et al. (1999, 2001) and Ko¨hler et al. (2000) showing that there is selection against Hsp expression in populations being exposed to chronic stress clearly demonstrates this problem.```

### Overall thoughts:

Not very informative in terms of what Hsps are actually doing and how they relate to upper thermal limits. What is the difference between protection and resistance? Tolerance? Some consistent wording would be nice. The paper focused too much on costs and benefits rather than adaptive variation. This is nice to know but what aspect of the thermal ecology do Hsps relate to? I would have hoped there would be a better discussion fo basal vs induced hsps.

### Page 19: 2017-01-31. SHC lab meeting reading: Ranga et al. 2017; Evol Ecol: Sibling Drosophila species (Drosophila leontia and Drosophila kikkawai) show divergence for thermotolerance along a latitudinal gradient

This study compares the different aspects of lower and upper thermal limits between two closely related species (*Drosophila*) in India across a wide climate gradient (8 -32 degrees north): 

1. *D. leontia*
2. *D. kikkawai*

==Measurements:==

1. **Upper thermal limits**
   * Heat knockdown time: 39 C treatment in water bath, measured time where they could not stand
   * Survival: 24 hour survey of flies 100% dead when treated at 39C over time (10-80min)
   * Hardening:
2. **Lower thermal limits**
   * Chill coma recovery time
     * 0C treatment for 8 hour then recover at room temp (22C); measured time they could stand upright
   * Cold survival 
     * 0 C treatment for 8 -96 hours, measured survival after 24hours
3. **Absolute hardening capacity (AHC)**
   * AHC = KT - C 
   * KT = thermotolerance after hardening
     * warm: (33, 35 or 37 C)
     * cool: (0, 2 or 4 C)
   * C = basal thermo-tolerance
4. **Relative hardening capacity**
   * RHC = (KT – C)/C
5. **Egg-to-adult viability**
   * Hot: eggs subected to 39 C 1 hour
   * Cold: eggs subjected to 0 C 12 hours
   * transferred to 22C 65% RH

## Results 

(Fig 2)

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * Clinal variation in Upper thermal limits (KD time, heat survival)
     * No benefit from hardening
   * No clinal variation in lower thermal limits ( CCRT, cold survival)
     * No benefit from hardening
2. *D. kikkawai* —==higher plasticity==
   * Clinal variation in Upper thermal limits (KD time, heat survival)
     - Benefit from hardening
   * Clinal variation in lower thermal limits ( CCRT, cold survival)
     - Benefit from hardening

Table 2: They did anova for each trait, testing the effect of each population

Why not do an ANCOVA:

```R
aov(Thermal trait~ Latitude * Species)
```



**Fig 3: Egg-to-Adult viability**

1. *D. leontia ==lower plasticity==*
   * Southern pop had higher viability under controls, heat stressed, but not cold stress. 
   * **Notes** *makes sense because they have no relationship to cold* 
   * ​
2. *D. kikkawai ==higher plasticity==*
   * Southern pop had higher viability under heat stress but lower under controls and cold stress.

**Fig 4: Mortality**

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * **HS:** No diff in mortality between hardening and controsl (consistent with fig 2)
   * **HS:** Southern had lower mortality  than north
   * **CS:** No diff between hardening and controls and pops
2. *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity==
   * **HS** higher mortality in control than hardened, makes sense; southern has lower mortality
   * **CS:**  Northern have lower mortality than south ; hardening has lower mortality

**Fig 5: AHC (Absolute hardening capacity) and RHC relative hardening capacity**: Same direction

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * no sig hardening between northern and southern pops
2. *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity==
   * Upper thermal limits: positive plasticity
     * Northern pops have higher upper thermal limits
   * Lower thermal limits: 
     * CCRT: northern have faster recovery time
     * survival: northern have higher survival



**Fig 6: Hardening vs pretreatment temperatures**

1. Upper thermal limits:
   * *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity== had higher hardening than *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity== for both KD time and survival
2. Lower thermal limits: 
   * *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity==  has higher cold tolerance than *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==

**Fig 7 looks the same, wtf**



**Figure 8** Focus on the climate variables each species experiences 

- North is more variable, south less variable (A)
- Tave and RH negatively related to latitude

1. *D. leontia* ==lower plasticity==
   * higher abundance at the warm end
2. *D. kikkawai* ==higher plasticity== 
   * higher abundance at the cold end 

## Thoughts 

* What is the demographic history? I ask because it can explain some of the results. 


* Optimal temp for D. leontia is the south and D. kikkawai is in the north. So D. leontia could be moving south to north and D. kikkawai could be moving north to south. 
* Painful read, could have analyzed the data differently.

### Page 21: 2017-02-03. Todgham et al. 2017; JEB, The effect of temperature adaptation on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in notothenioid fishes

Ref: Todgham AE, Crombie TA, Hofmann GE. 2016. The effect of temperature adaptation on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in notothenioid fishes. The Journal of Experimental Biology:jeb.145946.



**Background**

Ubiquitin tags proteins for degradation through the proteasome(protein chomper). In the face of heat stress, different species can adaptively modulate this pathway to cope with the deleterious effects of protein damage. <u>Antarctic species live in -1.9C while new zealand species live in 10C .</u>



**Objective:** Understand the thermal compensation of Ub-proteasome pathway in antarctic fish vs ones form warmer climates.

## Approach and workflow

**Compared ubiquitin ,proteasome activity and expression between 2 tissues (gill and liver) for 4 different fish species.** 

```mermaid

graph TD
A(Trematomus bemacchii) --> D{Antarctic fish}
B(Pagothenia borchgrevinki) --> D

R(Notothenia angustata) --> P{New Zealand}
G(Bovichtus variegatus) --> P

D --> M{Ub-proteasome pathway}
P --> M{Ub-proteasome pathway}

W --> T(CHIP)
W --> UbE2D1
W --> Ubiquitin

E --> PSMA2
E --> PSMB7
E --> PSMC1


```

**Figure 1: UB conjugated proteins**

Antarctic and N. angustata have higher ubiquitin tagged proteins than B. variegatus for both liver and gill. 



**FIgure 2. Protasome activity** 

Antactic have higher proteasome activity at 0 and 10 C for both gill and liver. The magnitidue of differences were higher in the gills. This may be why they focused only on the gills for gene expression 



**Figure 3: Gill gxp for UB related genes**

  General pattern as Fig 1. where antarctic fish and N. angustata have higher expression of UB realted gene expression than B. variegatus. But N. angustata had higher expression than the antarctic fish. There could be different dynamics that would be captured with a reaction norm approach. 



**Figure 4: Gil gxn for proteasome complex related genes.** 

Similar result as figure 1. (exxcept top panel) . But here we see categorical differences between Antarctic and new zealand. Antarctic fish have higher expression. 



## Thoughts:

 It looks like cold tolerant species up-regulate their protein degradation pathway. It fits the model that if proteins are too damaged, they're clear those proteins. 



Cool method to test for proteasome activity: (Coux et al., 1996)

1.  chymotrypsin-like activities, which cleaves after large hydrophobic residues
2.  trypsin-like activities, which cleaves after basic residues
3.  peptidylglutamylpeptide hydrolyzing activities, which cleaves after acidic residues .

Tomanek L, Somero GN. 2002. Interspecific- and acclimation-induced variation in levels of heat-shock proteins 70 (hsp70) and 90 (hsp90) and heat-shock transcription factor-1 (HSF1) in congeneric marine snails (genus Tegula): implications for regulation of hsp gene expression. J Exp Biol 205:677–685.



## Rational/Objectives/Questions

How do species adaptively vary in their stress response?



Species differ in vertical distribution

1. *Tegula brunnea* = subtidal 
2. *T. montereyi* = subtidal to low intertidal zones
3. *T. funerals* = low to mid intertidal zone (with wider latitudinal distribution) 
   * ==experiences the highest heat stress==



## Methods

1. Collected mid july and treated 13, 18 and 23 C for 30-34 days
2. Dissected tissues and isolated proteins
3. They measured protein levels of Hsp70/90/40, HSF with western blots.



## Take homes

*Our results indicate that the cellular thermometer model can account for intraspecific but not interspecific variation in Ton  and that the relative levels of expression of different isoforms of hsp70 may provide a better measure of heat stress than the total expression of all hsp70 isoforms.*



Figures are uninterpretable.

This is one of the few papers that compare the thermal reaction norms of Hsp  protein expression among 3 different species. These species vary in the thermal environment



Species: *Chlorostoma* formerly *Tegula*

1. C. funebralis = warm tolerance
2. C. brunnea = intermediate tolerance
3. C. montereyi = low to intermediate tolerance



Figure 1.

These species shift the reaction norm of Hsp protein expression to the right, in support for the tolerance mechanism. And C. funebralis shifts their max expression upwards at the higher temperature. 



Some species lack HSR:

1. Hydra lack a HSR (Bosch et al. 1988)
   * mRNA gets rapidly degraded
2. antarctic marine organisms have little HSR
   * lacks inducibility of HSPs



**Argues that the variation in the thermal reaction norms of Hsp expression is related to the temperature variation different taxanomic groups experience.**

<u>Title: Heat Shock proteins and stress tolerance</u>

* ​
* Protection (resistance) and tolerance are assumed to be the same (conflated). 
* Induced thermotolerance = heat hardening; when exposed to sublethal stress and Hsps increase , it can confer resistance to future temperature threats
* *Nutrient availability, o x y g e n tension, diurnal rhythms, and a host of other variables exert highly reproducible effects on thermotolerance.*
* *In general terms, hsps function by preventing the accumulation of stress-damaged proteins.*
* ​

How does heat stress damage cells?

* Heat damages a wide variety of cellular structures and metabolic proc e s s e s (for detailed reviews, see Nover 1991; Laszlo 1992).*
* *In higher eukaryotes, one of the most immediate effects of heat shock is extensive disruption of the cytoskeleton (Falkner et al. 1981; Coss et al. 1982; Glass et al. 1985; Welch and Suhan 1985; Iida et al. 1 9 8 6 ) .*
* The golgi gets fragmented and number  of lysosomes increase.
* Mitochondria swell and decrease in number— decrease in oxidative phosphorylation
* influence gene expression; reduced
* DNA synthesis is slowed; inhibit chromatn assembly; DNA becomes unstable
* *The total protein content of the nucleus also increases with heat shock (Laszlo 1992).*
* changes lipid membranes; increased fluidity of bilayer and aggregation of integral membrane proteins

What is  the response?

* *In many cases, mild heat pretreatments, which induce hsp synthesis, either reduce the extent of these perturbations or speed their repair.*
* *Unfortunately, although we know that hsps have a central role in thermotolerance and have learned a great deal about the general biochemical functions of these proteins, w e still do not k n ow which heatinduced cellular perturbations are responsible for lethality or w h i c h lethal lesions are the most susceptible to repair by hsps.*

## Hsp70 function in stress tolerance (so this paper frames in term of tolerance)

* *early experiments showed a c l o s e correlation between their induction and the induction of tolerance to high temperatures (Li and Werb 1982; Li and Laszlo 1985; Subjeck and Shyy 1986).*
  * Li & Werb 1982 compare thermal tolerance with Hsp protein expression

Where is hsp70 localized during HS?

* concentrated in membrane, nuclei, and nucleoli (*Pelham 1984; Pelham et al. 1984; Velazquez and Lindquist 1984; Welch and Feramisco 1984*)



**In a f ew experiments, differences in thermotolerance among cultivars have been correlated with differences in hsp synthesis (Ougham and Stoddart 1986; Howarth 1989; Krishnan et al. 1989). **



**In o n e case, however, where the cosegregation of hsp polymorphisms and thermotolerance polymorphisms was examined, no simple correlation was observed (Fender and O'Connell 1989). **

### Page 25: 2017-02-07. How far down do Aphaenogaster colonies go in the winter?

Lubertazzi 2012 has the answer. 



```
4.1.4.Winter. In winter months colonies avoid freezing temperatures
by maintaining their nests below ground. Talbot
[24] found the average depth of 5 winter colonies inMissouri
to be 25 cm. Colonies in Connecticut appear to prefer deeper
nests, to a depth of at least 50 cm. Developmental processes
enter a diapause and worker activity within the nest is
minimal.

```

==Depending on where they are, 25-50 cm!!!==

### Page 26: 2017-02-07. A definition of a trade-off.

Reading Saltz et al. 2017, Trait Correlations in the Genomics Era; published in *TREE*



I like this: 



```
However, predictions about the evolutionary dynamics of trait correlations go beyond heritability: often we
are interested in why traits are correlated, whether the correlation evolved under selection, and
whether it is possible for selection or drift to change the magnitude or direction of trait
correlations.
```



Trade-off definition:

==Trade-offs occur when functional relationships among traits prevent evolution of optimum values for all traits simultaneously.==



or…when the relationships among traits prevent the evolution of optimal values for all traits simultaneously. 



or

when the correlational structure of functional traits are at odds with selection such that the suite of traits are not optimized.



## Thoughts

Should there be a distinction between a negative correlation among traits as a ==functional trade off==, vs how selection operates on traits to limit trait values in the next generation as an ==evolutionary trade off==?  Because if seleciton operates in the same direction of traits that are negatively correlated, then trait values are optimized. If seleciton operates perpendicular, then that'd be a trade off. 



I like this too:



```
Quantitative genetics theory suggests that identifying genetic loci underlying trait correlations can contribute to answering these questions. Specifically, quantitative trait loci can produce trait correlations through pleiotropy, in which a single locus causally affects two or more traits,
or through linkage, in which two or more loci each affect different traits, but are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and therefore are inherited together (Box 1). This distinction is important because trait correlations caused by pleiotropy are expected to evolve (adaptively and by drift) differently than trait correlations caused by LD. In general, because LD is expected to erode
through recombination, trait correlations generated by LD are expected to be transient and therefore have a limited scope for contributing to evolutionary change. Similarly, if a trait correlation is caused by LD, each trait might be produced by distinct functional mechanisms
```

### Page 27: 2017-02-09. SHC lab meeting: Practice talk for biolunch and dissertation defense



SHC : overall intro is fine, you'll give it better every time you do it. you'll get smoother. 



==SHC has problem with question:==

What types of adaptations are needed to evolve into different environments?

What types of adaptations are needed to colonize different environments? (might want to be more specific, "thermally extreme environments")



SHC wants me to avoid, performance is physiology/ behavior. performance relates to fitness. They are not the same thing. 

In slide 8; I'm showing TPC's across a temperature gradient. The whole thing is shifting, but what im saying is that only ctmax is changing. thinka bout this. display diff



slide 9: there is an issue with me only presenting 1 option. There are other ways!!! don't necessarily talk about other ways. 

Slide 11: Engage with the figure: Here are the 3 heat shock proteins, but if i have a pathway, i better show how it works. Rethink. 



Slide 17: this is vague. I mean that the "dynamics of how they are used". This is what i want to stress. "Temperature selection" is too vague and I can say something more specific. 



Slide 18: this is confusing: too fast, both slide 18 and 19 have positive slopes and how ar they different? 

SHC suggestion: I want to get across, how do i use hsps to be better protected? Have them there all the time! Get across in plain english

Slide 19: Tolerance: when you do get damage, you repair it , turn on when needed and turn on stronger.

==Went too fast; and with graphs, it is hard for audience to get it==. Bar graph instead to give people the words (SHC is not sure)



If HSPs are contributing to thermal limits, how are they doing it? SHC confused as to why upper thermal limits is on y axis

==get rid of slide 20==



Slide 21: title is bad, instead: ants live in different environments. colonized environments from extremely cold to extremely hot!

Slide 22: Question 2 needs adjustments. How implies that it assumed they already adaptively vary. "relate" is vague, be more precise. 

Question 3 is awkward. SHC is not sure, think about how to frame it . How do upper thermal limits interact with other elements of physiology that relates to or influence species survival. or where species occur or performance 



slide 24: NOt clear that i used drosophila for blast search. Which ones in fruit flies are heat inducible? 

SHC suggestion: Save housekeeping business for this slide. Some are for heat response and some are for housekeeping function. Use fruit flies as a reference. Adds to story about shifts taht have gone on in these proteins used in ants as opposed to other insects. it is dynamic. 

==KM suggestions==

conclusions for each chapter was unclear:

multiple stressors: symbols for desiccation and starved were the same. change colors!

----

Slide 25: give a road map for the first time when i present hsp83 gene trees and regulatory elements. diverse group….some might not understand how you can infer duplication on a gene tree. 

**Slide 27: call it hsc70-4  instead of hsp70.**

What is going on with bombus? 



==Slide 30: have contrasting slide, meaning show hsp orthologues not heat inducible!==

Slide 31: Flat title. Conservation and innovation——say something about the evolutionary dynamics of hsps….they are conserved in fucntion, but there is alot of opportunity for innovation. Switch between housekeeping to inducible. There is more to be explored….i.e. subfunctionalization. Not a simple answer, there is a complex answer. Conserved function but the individual players is not static!



One time to make general statements about the implications of the work Im doing. Generalize so you can make general comments about biology. dont overstate but think critically!

Slide 33: both hypotheses don't belong on the same slide

Ask…whether there are adpative shifts in upper thermal limits when ants colonize novel environments. 

==This is what i want to know….==

Extension or enhancement of thermal limits. If you live in a warmer place, can you withstand higher temperatures.  

==if so, how do you do it?== Are hsps involved, how!?

**important**

Then go to the clade. species are structured along the cline. colonieze east coast over X million years. and they have colonized open environments. 

==Bonnie comments==

When i go into the predictions, make it explicit that they are predictions. 

Four main questions was confusing. I only have 3 points, but bonnie was expecting 4. 

Make sure im' clear on DW and FW

**MIstake** : I'm assuming that everybody will understand a phylogenetically informed appraoch. Give overview of approach! What is the phylogeny doing? Set up the audience to understand. More important to be understandable than lenght. 

Slide 35-40 I need to use titles!1



==Conclusion to CTmax part: I set up conflict, but my conclusion does not resolve the conflict.== Needs to be in plain english. 

Are the differences in CTmax explained by differences in how Hsps are used? 

**How does graded protection help/work?**



Tolerance mechanism is not a driver, it's a response to something else that is reducing the incidence of protein denaturing. 

Max is more about repair. 

three possibilities: 

1. protection - active
2. repair - active
3. tolerance - passive

Frame your question! Think about this to tell a precise story. 



RXN norm slides: connect it to something. Issue with how people study this. ANOVA approaches misses elements of adaptive changes in responses 



DW buffer thermal environment compared to FW.  Use data to decide whether i focus on habitat differences or to include cline in ctmax. 



For cahpter 2 conclusion: wrap up the whole chapter…thermal limits and hsp. Evolutionary lability or flexibilty in how hsps are used can lead or ability to colonize new habitats. LInk hsps back to habitat. integrate the data better

Natural shift to last question: The data i have might suggest, in the framework of climat change….DF species might be more protected because they dont get exposed to extremes. HOWEVER, climate change is not about change in temprature….but the constellation of chagnes associated with climate change . INcreases in temperature, other things are changing….other stressors can lead species to become more vulnerable. 

**Goals instead of topics.** Last part could be integrating my results with current climate chagne patterns. 



Slide 68: hypothesis slide for multiple stressors section

I have "or", split up the hypothesis

Slide 70: x axis in predictions could be severity. Overall, predictions are abstract. Explain cross protection or susceptibility mechanisms. ie extra stressor improves or reduces them. NO need for complex prediction slides. Why would another stressor can ever help you? (link back to HSPs…but don't need to add the data;; but you need the explanation)

You need methods: treatments, knockdown time explanation. All results need statistics.  Play with overall conclusion.

### Page 29: 2017-02-15. Aphaenogaster, Hsp rxn norm paper stats revisited: 

From previous analysis, I've found that there is a main effect of Tmax and Habitat type on CTmax in Aphaenogaster. 

```R

Ok, what if I take out flat woods species, do I still get clinal variation? 

```R
#subset data
aphsub<-subset(Aph.dat,Aph.dat$habitat_v2!="flat woods")
#construct model without habitat, sinece only focusing on deciduous forest species

## General info on sampling 

**Species numbers**

```R
table(droplevels(Aph.dat$rad_seq_species))

     ashmeadi     floridana         fulva 
            9             9             9 
  lamellidens      miamiana         picea 
            4            13            26 
        rudis tennesseensis 
           28             2 
```

**Habitat numbers**

```R
table(droplevels(Aph.dat$habitat_v2))

deciduous forest       flat woods 
              84               16 
```

**Number of sites:**

```R
 length(unique(Aph.dat$site))
[1] 34
```

**Range of Tmax * 10**

```R
 range(Aph.dat$bio5)
[1] 249 333
```



### For pca of hsp parameters:

```R
> pchsp$sdev
   Comp.1    Comp.2    Comp.3    Comp.4    Comp.5 
2.1385967 1.3517804 1.0759241 1.0023266 0.8465922 
   Comp.6    Comp.7    Comp.8    Comp.9   Comp.10 
0.8464922 0.7749836 0.6587774 0.5320244 0.4468818 
  Comp.11   Comp.12 
0.3442608 0.2738906 
```

Here are the eigenvalues, and I want to get the number of dimensions $\frac{\lambda_{total}}{\lambda_{1}}$

```R
sum(pchsp$sdev)/pchsp$sdev[1]
4.81275 
```

Closer to 1 means that most of the variation mong these traits is captured by first pc. The larger the number, more PCs capture most of the variation among these traits.

### Page 31: 2017-02-21. Measuring evolutionary rates in darwins and haldanes  

I thought this was [cool](http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/courses.hp/biol606/OldLecs/rateunits.html):

a darwin ($d$): a change by a factor $e$ per million years



$$rate (d) =  \frac{ln(x_2)- ln(x_1)}{\Delta t}$$



* $ln(x_1)$ and $ln(x_2)$ are two sample means of natural logarthms of measurements
* $\Delta t$ is the time difference between the two samples in millions of years



a haldane (h): a change by a factor of one standard deviation per generation

$$rate(h) = \frac{\frac{lnx_2}{Sln_x}-\frac{lnx_1}{Slnx}}{t_2 - t_1}$$

* $ln(x_1)$ and $ln(x_2)$ are two sample means of natural logarthms of measurements
* $Slnx$ is the pooled standard deviation of $lnx_1$ and $lnx_2$ values
* $t_2 - t_1$ is the time difference between two samples, measured in generations

### Page 32: 2017-02-22. Resistance vs Tolerance strategies to stress; paper notes-**Núñez-Farfán et al. 2007**; The Evolution of Resistance and Tolerance to Herbivores; Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst.

I want to get a sense of how the herbivore-plant literature uses certain words for responding to stress and potentially adopt that framework in temperature stress. 

1. **Resistance:** Constitutive or induced response of plants against herbivory to avoid or reduce the amount of damage
2. **Tolerance:**  Response of plants induced after consumption to buffer the negative fitness effect of damage. 

These definitions seem inter-related. For example, an induced response that can avoid or reduce damage could also buffer the negative effects of damage. So, a molecule (secondaryy compound) can participate in both resistance and tolerance. I think the difference is the timing of herbivory. Meaning, if a molecule turns on early, it is acting to resist herbivory damage. But if a molecule turns on after herbivory, then it's action will tolerate the damage already done. 

In the coral literature, they like to use ["frontloading"](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/4/1387.full) as another term for resistance. 

```
ref: Barshis DJ, Ladner JT, Oliver TA, et al (2013) Genomic basis for coral resilience to climate change. PNAS 110:1387–1392. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1210224110
```

**In Fineblum and Rausher 1995;** they explain tolerance as the amount of reduced fitness for a given amount of damage, but resistance is the amount of damage a plant experiences for a given abundance of herbivores. 

```
ref:   Fineblum WL, Rausher MD (1995) Tradeoff between resistance and tolerance to herbivore damage in a morning glory. Nature 377:517–520. doi: 10.1038/377517a0
```

**A diff expalantion of tolerance and resistance by Mauricio et al. 1997:**

<u>Resistance:</u> Traits that reduce the amount of damage a plant experienced. 

<u>Tolerance:</u> Ability of plant to sustain a fixed amount of herbivore damage without reduction in fitness.

A gem in this paper for the definition of a trade off:

> For example, a negative correlation between two characters, both within and across species, is often taken to indicate the existence of tradeoffs between those characters (Cheverud 1984, Tilman 1990).

```
ref:   Mauricio R, Rausher MD, Burdick DS (1997) Variation in the Defense Strategies of Plants: Are Resistance and Tolerance Mutually Exclusive? Ecology 78:1301–1311. doi: 10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[1301:VITDSO]2.0.CO;2
```



In a diff system, but another [paper's definition](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000150): 

>  Two routes to decreasing susceptibility to infection are resistance (the ability to clear pathogens) and tolerance (the ability to limit damage in response to pathogens).

```
ref:   Ayres JS, Schneider DS (2009) The Role of Anorexia in Resistance and Tolerance to Infections in Drosophila. PLOS Biology 7:e1000150. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000150
```

Makes no sense….clearing pathogens limits the damage…And clearing a pathogen involves sensing and then responding to pathogens. 

> The first, resistance, is the ability of the host to reduce pathogen levels. The second, tolerance, is the ability to limit the impact of infections.

This makes more sense. 

**Thoughts:** 

I think there are two distinct parts of stress:

1. Whether you encounter it at all. This should involve resistance because there can be ways for organisms to avoid or reduce the amount of stress
2. What do you do when you encounter stress? You can limit the damage caused by it. 

But there is a continuum right? Especially for temperature. 

### How would I define resistance or tolerance in terms of thermal stress biology? Or more generally?  

Resistance is a response (either induced or already present) that impedes disruption of a complex trait/biological system from a perturbation. 

Tolerance is a response that mitigates the disruption of a complex trait/biological system from a perturbation. 

Not sure about these definitions. In real biology, how would this work?

```
		 resistance
		|-----
		|	  \
		|	   \
fitness  |		 \
		|		   -------
		|           tolerance
		______________________
		      leaf damage
```

The amount of leaf damage that does not decrease fitness is resistance. The part where the curve begins to change is tolerance. Can use a breakpoint analysis. 

```
		 
		|		--------
		|	   /  		 \
		|	 /	   		  \
fitness  |	/	 			\
		|/
		|           
		______________________
		      Temperature
```

The slope at the ends would indicate tolerance. But the width of topt may be resistance. 

Not sure this works.

Calculating basal expression. Subtracting ct values of hsp83,hsc70-4, and hsp40 from 18srRNA ct values. And then log2 transforming the data to get a measure of basal expression 

```R
basalxp<-log2(jj[,3:5] - jj[,74])
jj<-data.frame(jj,basalxp)
```



Constructing the multiple regression model:

```R
regmod<-lm(KO_temp_worker~hsc70.1+hsp83.1+hsp40.2+FC_hsc70_1468_max+FC_hsc70_1468_slope+FC_hsc70_1468_Tm+FC_hsp40_541_max+FC_hsp40_541_slope+FC_hsp40_541_Tm+FC_Hsp83_279_max+FC_Hsp83_279_slope+FC_Hsp83_279_Tm,data=jj)
```

Model selection based on AIC in both directions (forward and backwards):

```R
summary(stepAIC(regmod,direction="both"))
#output
Call:
lm(formula = KO_temp_worker ~ hsp40.2 + FC_hsc70_1468_max + FC_hsp40_541_slope + 
    FC_hsp40_541_Tm + FC_Hsp83_279_max + FC_Hsp83_279_slope, 
    data = jj)

### Another set of analyses: 

> Also, can you test the relationship between the PCs and CTmax without the open habitat species?  This is to see if the same axis of variation also underlies CTmax variation without the big jump associated with the habitat shift.



Assembling dataset with pcs of hsp params with original data:

```R
jj3<-data.frame(jj,hspparams)

summary(jj3$habitat_v2)
#deciduous forest       flat woods 
 #             32                9 

noop<-subset(jj3,jj3$habitat_v2!="flat woods")
#summary(lm(KO_temp_worker~pc1+pc2+pc3,data=noop))
summary(lm(KO_temp_worker~pc1,data=noop))
